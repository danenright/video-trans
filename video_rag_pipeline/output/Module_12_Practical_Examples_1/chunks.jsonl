Now as you will notice, the market is moving rather aggressively with an accelerated play towards the downside as auctioning activity really has accelerated and picked up and So you can see this little area, less than a thousand lots being traded between $163.85 and $86. And what's happened now, and this is what we're going to be looking at in this play over here, is that the market has left another low volume load and because the auctioning activity is picking up and we're approaching actually a key daily level and we're picking of activity really start showing and indicating on the balance of probabilities that a momentum play is on the cards because the market is auctioning very aggressively towards the downside. So again what we're going to be looking at over here is the BUN market, the execution order flow type is momentum. The pattern type is a passive momentum positioning place. It's not a volume slam dunk It's not a stop-hunter play, but it's where you'll actually position a little bit more passively At the edge of some low volume node positioning areas at the market does not want to trade as it seeks New value as it starts trading towards the downside So what you effectively do with your training status strategy you working sell side offers once you see first auctioning price So what I mean by that first auctioning? price again the first time it actually starts auctioning an area whilst not auctioning any of this zone so you're positioning yourself anywhere below the low volume node and where the market actually starts auctioning and what we'll observe this video at the 75s I want you to look at is how it auctions in this area over here. The latter market environment increasing momentum, high velocity, high activity. You want to be seeing a lot of activity going on in in this region, in this area. So you really want to keep a close high that the auctioning activity is picking up. It's picking up towards breakout level. And as it's picking up towards breakout level, well you can employ a volume slam dunk play, but if you have more of a passive approach, you're going to be positioning behind, just below in this instance, the low volume nodes. So let's just clear up this picture a little bit and Again, what we're looking for is a break towards that level, we've got this low volume node over here. And what we want to see now, if we want to continue towards the downside, we're going to start positioning on the sell side when we see for the first time auctioning protection,", "transcript": "Okay, welcome to another video analysis of an order flow pattern that what we will be looking at over here is a passive LVN play for a momentum breakout trade.

So now let's have a look how this market develops. you can see the trading activity picking up you know another 139 knots you can see that it's consistently there two and a half thousand knots so you're finding a short entry here finding a short entry over here and then you're looking for the break towards the downside and as the market really starts tracking on towards the downside you are protecting yourself from all these low volume zones so immediately if you're short 75 over here your risk really is three ticks or if it starts trading to this region it shouldn't trade at the next high volume node at 79 so you position short over here as the market continues trucking down you have another type of auctioning zone over here so you can potentially look for another possible short in this region over here but this is where you have the protection over here at the 75 the 76's region for this passive LVN play as a market activity and the auctioning is really picking up region over here. So you're short to 75 to 74 and you're looking for your downside playing. You'll be holding this trade you might be scaling out some of your position but holding a core position until you see the activity really slowed down as the market really starts moving towards the downside. You can see leaving another low volume node over here at the 70 once only 802 lots here only at 74 only 488 lots of the market is really showing strong intent as it starts moving towards the downside You can see a big order coming through on the order book as the bids are being slammed and the offers are really strong as the market really moves with good initiation, good volatility, good exchange.
