There are four parts, part 9, 10, 11 and 12. Each part will begin with a little bit of theory and end with unique trading strategies based on volume profiling. In part 9 you can expect to discuss composite market profiling as a theoretical principle with some examples. we will then go over high volume areas and low volume areas and then I will show you how to develop your very own unique trading strategies after that I'm going to show you some of the strategies that I've developed over the last few years. Now in part nine we will focus on a nominally type of strategies including the low volume area and a high volume double distribution strategy Then in part 10 we're going to move on to principles of developing your pre-open routine and trading templates before discussing momentum volume profiling strategies. These will include the open drive, the confluence initial balance breakout, the consolidation Then in part 11 we are going to discuss the principle of using the price ladder with volume profiles to make trading decisions as well as the trading secret. We will then move on to trend strategies based on the volume profile. Then, in the final part, part 12, we will discuss the principle of the art of probability as well as developing your own playbook. We will then finish part 12 with the last of our strategy sets, which will be reversal strategies and these will be the gap day and the gapful tail reversals before we finally finish off with a final word. Good luck and enjoy module 3.", "transcript": "Module 3's index looks as follows. There are four parts, part 9, 10, 11 and 12.
