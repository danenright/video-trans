This area here, this initiative up move, and what I was just explaining was how you have this really tight distribution in here, the blue is representing the initial balance and how we distribute around it and just accept value down here, and then how the this this absorption and then what how it looks in this area here and once we start to move away from value how we can really um have a clean clean clean break and clean move but like just to give you the overview on the right hand side is my daily profile and you can see here that we had this we had this sort of low-volume low-volume cave in here uh... on We opened outside of value, traded down, couldn't find an offer at any lower, we put in a buying tail, originally a buying tail, and then we started to rotate back up towards the highs and then we had this sort of initiative move up and I just want you guys to see how in regards to this profile here on Tuesday, how just technically this is set up very repositioning move in the market sort of thing so you got this like net short move here on the Tuesday from when everyone's you had this initiative selling and accumulation here and then this sort of when it reverses how you can kind of take advantage of it instead of being the guy selling it the whole way which is something you're about to see for myself so let's get on into the ladder guys.

Don't be the guy selling it to the clear buyer in control of the market. Don't be the guy stepping there in front of the train. Let the train stop without making it really oversimplifying this. Let the train stop and just understand. Okay, so now how I'm going to position myself, I'm going to have a tight wrist, you know, it's like, there's nothing wrong with buying the high of the market in terms of these move guys, in terms of like, you want to be with the initiative, I mean, let's look, watching over here, I mean, you're seeing just any sort of clips down are just being brought up and are just, are just being soaked up and bid up again, any sort of selling is just being used to kind of just, it's just finding liquidity and just squeezing people out of it, it's not doing, it's no real initiative positions, um. being put back into the market on the short side whereas everyone here is just paying up sort of thing it's all about understanding the the overall structure of the market how we're trading how um how you know how can we execute in accordance to the profile sort of thing and like you know just as you see here i mean i won't keep it too much longer because i think you guys kind of get the principle of what i'm trying to say but you know just know it's just it's all about and once you start to so you start to leave prices right so now you say And you have this low volume area here. So just now notice how we start the trade. So we've had this volume pocket here. We've had this volume accumulation between fives, fours, and sixes sort of thing. And now we're sort of reloading above that. So we're accepting prices above here. We're moving away from this low volume here. We're accepting prices even higher. $700 has got reloaded at the second highest price of the day again, guys. Any clips up into here is sort of so aggressive in terms of, you know... of the move that you want to sort of go with. Don't get me wrong, it's coming to the extreme of the move here, but it's all about just gauging, let the market tell you when the extreme has been put in sort of thing. Don't have to be the hero trying to sell the high in every move like this sort of thing. As you'll see here, how I'm now trying to work out of my position, and as you can see very clearly in this moment of time, I'm not taking into accordance the daily structure, how we're actually positioned,", "transcript": "of market profile theory, yeah, sure, you've got values, so except you're down here, and you're expecting a rotational error, I mean, in theory, that's a great trade, and you know, and like how I work, I'm being tough myself in this moment because, because I've seen this move play out today and the price action that I've liked so much and it was such a clean move but you know just you know when does the okay so right yes yes we have this initiative move and values is set down here right but okay so what happens you know once we start to build structure here when we like okay so what point does the move when does the momentum die out like I say it's all about judging when there is momentum so in this move up so on the actual initial up move there is momentum there is there is that kind of staggered bid You have that staggered bid on the way up, and then at what point does that stop, right?

This is all just people paying up and just getting squeezed out of positions and especially when it's such a tight, balanced week as well. This week as a whole is so tightly balanced and just been distributing between two areas really. That's all we've been doing, just washing out one side and accumulating at one end and then washing out the other side. That's all we've been doing. And don't get me wrong, you can trade this market so well and you can make really good money in it, but it's just about understanding the positioning, you know. Do you want to be sort of sitting in this trade and taking all this pain like I'm doing right now for a minimal reward, or do you want to be the guy saying, right, so you've been getting long in here sort of thing and you're kind of adding the whole way up and then let the market tell you right? I'm now done here sort of thing. You know, yes, there's a level between 66 and 64s, but how do we trade there, guys? Like, yes, there was an initial scalp sort of thing, like two, three ticks maybe to nick a thing, but then once we start to rotate there, sort of build structure there, how can we then move away? Where does that passive buyer turn aggressive sort of thing? Where does the move from value fail, or where does it continue sort of thing? Now, that's kind of just something that I was really, really, oh, sorry, really focused on today, Yeah, it's just something that I felt was really clean in execution and you could have really got a lot of sides away on this trade, this move, but I hope that you find that guide helpful. For my final thoughts today, I don't know, like I said, there's no right trade in this kind of, this job is different in anything else in terms of like, in that trade there you were seeing me execute one way. But you and you can still make money off that trading that that type of way and the stuff to say there's no wrong What I'm trying to get there's no wrong trade in this job sort of thing There's no as long as you print green at the end of the day. There is nothing wrong. So like When you know all you can do is just take the trades that make sense, you know All you can do is sort of understand The general you know, you can just lean on on and you have to identify what to lean on at the moment So for me at the moment I'm feeling that the profile is something that you heavily have to lean on in terms of you know let you need to see a change in something right it's like another thing I've written down myself like at what point does the price section or the structure change to allow you to say not go against what you've been told so far but at what point does right so something has clearly changed here how can I take advantage of it and then in a and where can I execute sort of", "transcript": "high in every move like this sort of thing.
