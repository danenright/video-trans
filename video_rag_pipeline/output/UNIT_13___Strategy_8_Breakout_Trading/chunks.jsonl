What happens if this Apple isn't red? What happens if this Apple is truly yellow and that's the crux of what tonight's about guys What I want you to understand is the markets don't reward the obvious They don't reward if you told me that Apple's red.

So into the strategy unit now of Breakouts trading now. I know a lot of you are probably very excited about this strategy session Simply because breakout trading is probably something most traders have at least experienced in some Format now my hope is obviously by not just the end of the strategy session, but by the end of the unit You'll have a very objective Processed approach to executing your breakouts. Okay the information. I'm going to give you in the next couple of heading, whilst seemingly obvious, it's actually filled with some really big pitfalls in which most traders fall into. Now what I am going to say is that if you do follow the really processed based approach I'm going to show you, you can increase the probability of your success with breakouts tremendously. Okay, now before we move on to that, I just want to talk very briefly about this Okay, unfortunately in this day and age we tend to think that things are either right or wrong and Unfortunately, we taught this from a young school age when you write a test you get given a tick or a cross So everything in our lives is right or wrong. Trading is no different. If you do well or you do seemingly well You make profit if you do seemingly badly you make loss Okay Now I really really want you guys if there's one thing I can get across in the strategy session Lose the idea of right and wrong. There's no such thing in trading Okay, I've seen traders do what I feel is seemingly the wrong thing at the wrong time and make a lot of these things, make a lot of profit. Okay, I've seen traders do the right things at the right time and take a big loss. Okay, so there is no right or wrong in trading. If you can start off by believing in that principle, you're really on the right process The reason I want you to get away from this idea of right and wrong is because when you start to think things as right or wrong, you naturally start to create a bias. When you create a bias, you can no longer have a growth mindset. In other words, like I said to you, if I showed you obviously a red apple, it doesn't matter how much I argue with you, it doesn't matter how much I try and prove it to Okay, you've got a bias, you know what red is, you're never gonna believe my side, doesn't matter how much objectivity I can show you, you're just not gonna be willing to listen and learn.", "transcript": "You know components of this trade strategy session will be liquidity as well as again our color lines Okay, good luck with the trade strategy session.

Okay, now that's obviously the first element I wanna sort of... Now, the second thing is and it came out of the mentor session was this concept of an exact approach. A lot of young traders, even a lot of developed traders are really going in search of an exact approach. They almost want some form of 100% if A equals B then do C. Now, unfortunately guys, we are discretionary traders, we are not algorithmic traders. So by that very definition, if you want to develop an exact process, then you need to obviously look more towards an algorithmic type of approach. Okay, there's certain rules governing algorithmic trading. There's certain rules governing discretionary trading. There's certain rules governing hedge funds Okay, there's certain rules governing institutional trading, but those rules differ depending on what? In which element of the market you find yourself now note the last thing I want to sort of just mention This is something I've learned You know throughout my career and you're going to learn this through the books that I share with you the reason I recommend these books Okay, it's not because I think they're gonna teach you to become great traders Okay, I give them to you because I want them to provoke thought Okay now When your thoughts are provoked one of two things is gonna happen. Okay, you're either gonna adopt the principle In other words, you're gonna believe in the principle. You're gonna adopt it into everyday life It'll become a part of you or you're gonna ignore the principle. Okay, and you're gonna move forward Now, that's the purpose of every book, I want to provoke your thought, and I ultimately want you to adopt some principles that you find valid, and ignore the rest. Okay, but the most important thing, and this is the key to thought provoking principles, is that just because you adopt a principle does not make it yours. Okay, and this is the same in trading, we see there's so many successful strategies, so many successful trades, you know, I'm showing you guys 10 unique strategies here. It's so important that you recognize the real truth, which is that I can only show you principles Okay, I can only give you the principles. That's all I can give you. Yes I can show you trade strategies that work.

All of you should be saying to yourself, well yeah, okay, breakouts are pretty obvious. You just look at a chart, there's maybe a double bottom or a, you know, like a really key inside day and therefore there should be a breakout, okay? So we're all good at identifying it. But guess what? If you can see a chart, so can every other retail trader in the world, so can every other algorithm in the world, so can every other banker in the world, everyone can see a breakout, okay? So the first thing to note is that a breakout, is obvious public knowledge now i hope straight away you're going oh okay i didn't realize that because guess what if a breakout is public obvious knowledge then it means that there's likely to be a lot of noise why because there's many participants okay so that's the first thing to understand about breakout rates it's very very obvious now the reason why most people on breakout trades is very simple. Most people don't understand the basic logic behind what creates a breakout trade. And because they don't know what creates the basic elements of a breakout trade, they don't know how to execute in terms of timing. So what ends up happening? If I draw a basic example, we have this really key resistance, great breakout level, nice dark blue line because we've identified this key resistance. people get long, goes up, tests, fails, comes back, they stop out maybe they buy it again on a little fail break, stops down, comes back maybe they buy one last time at the high, stops, starts to turn over they give up.

Now, what the whole strategy-based templates teach you is that that's not good enough. You don't just go and say, okay, well, that didn't work. We look at all the various elements, every single element around this breakout from time, relative changes, delta, all these things, we look at them and we break them down one by one by one because that's where we pick up on the subtleties. This is the reason why so many people end up failing because they don't know how to time a breakout Now before we get on to me showing you The key principles of how to time a breakout. Let's just discuss something else That's quite important and pertinent to breakouts. Okay. The first is the auction process In order to understand an auction process or a breakout. Sorry, you have to understand how an auction process works Okay, let's go back to basic Elementary stuff. Sorry. I know I go through these things over and over again, but the whole point is that you can understand the philosophies the principles So that you can ultimately become better at breakout rates. Okay, so the basic premise is that's a discount and That's a premium and ultimately what happens is the market will tend to find fair value within that price range until such a point That this fair value is no longer That should say longer valid Okay, now the moment and only at that moment that fair value is no longer valid Will initiative be taken in one direction or the other and that's the key that if there's one thing you take away from that breakout camera writers Break. Oh jeep. Sorry guys. Apologies for the spelling.

So the first one, in order for a breakout to be successful, all participants will be in agreement. In other words, in order for a breakout to be successful, we need obviously number one, the initiative. But what we don't want is we don't want someone suddenly responding on the other side. So we don't want someone providing liquidity on the other side on a breakout. So we need all participants, all of them, influential, algorithmic and speculative. We need them all in agreement.

They're actually gonna lift through the breakout zone okay so that's why we do tend to see buyer absorption rather than buyers being aggressive initially now the second then is obviously the delta as i mentioned there okay you're going to suddenly see a shift in the color so what you'll typically see if this is maybe the bar just before a break you might have been seeing a whole bunch of light colors light colors light colors and suddenly just before the break you get this really really dark color Okay, nice dark blue or something again a nice visual representation of the sudden shift That's coming from the initiative being taken by potential big participants Now the third is obviously relative changes in either volume or price variance. So again What you will see a lot of the time is Within this maybe consolidation zone or even absorption auctioning zone. You might not see a great deal going on and all of a sudden you'll see the volume sort of ticking across ticking across maybe 1 000 lots every couple of minutes and suddenly just before the break you suddenly see it moved to 3 000 contracts okay again another very very important clue that something has shifted okay the game has changed and we're about to respond in terms of price all right The price, again, this is another clue you're going to see. I will show you an example of this, but we're price, the variance of price changes. So again, if we're used to seeing maybe five tick rotations, five tick rotation, and then suddenly you get a 12 tick rotation, this is a real clue, again, that something has shifted. The initiative is now being taken. Okay, obviously that ties in with velocity in terms of expansion. So again, velocity isn't necessarily directional, be careful, do note that, just like volatility doesn't mean trend, okay, it doesn't mean that because there's velocity or, it doesn't mean because there's volatility or velocity that prices are going up or down, okay, And then the last one is obviously an imbalance, so sometimes what we really see just before the break is some sort of an imbalance. Again, the imbalance you're more likely to see when the market isn't necessarily beginning the breakout at the extreme, it might be beginning the breakout here, maybe the initiative starts and within that initiative we initially get some form of an imbalance. In this early example where the breakout begins early, this is obviously giving you a far better opportunity to execute for a much bigger winner in terms of a breakout. Why?

This is where we get a really good feeling for this and understand this a little bit better. So the first example is the pound against the dollar. This is the 17th of November and what's interesting about this is obviously this started in the middle of the range. So I think that's the important thing to note. It did start mid-range. So breakouts can occur mid-range and that's why Okay, so important and that's also why we have got our blue lines in place Okay, so We put those blue lines because sometimes the market might begin the process of a breakout very early on now Let's take a little look at the key signal. We got you now the first I'm gonna bring your attention to the bottom Just look at the volume dynamic so we can see not a great deal going on Market began the process of rotating a little bit lower Again, I will show you this in a live trading example, but what I want you to focus on more now is the clue. So, we can see very clearly, the clue was the market tried to go backward and straight away someone sold very, very aggressively, so there was a really big seller. Note, once that buyer identified the seller, notice how it begins the process of sitting out. we started to see the seller become far more intentional and aggressive. So we got the clue, there's our clue, and the market suddenly responded in a very, very, very aggressive manner. Okay, obviously note some of the imbalances with some of the zeros, some more imbalances, and ultimately a very aggressive wash down. Okay, now some of the key sort of factors that we pay attention to, obviously, we want to see that pick up the Always simply looking for is we're looking for that clue once that clue comes in we're looking for an opportunity to enter now The best part about a clue is the stop Okay, because if we have a clue, where does the stop go? It's very simple. We should not be Clearing that clue. So it's very simple. This is why breakout trading can be so lucrative because you've got maximum Risk reward. Okay.

Okay, so 11 goes to 18 0 goes to 39 Again another little imbalance 39 to 129 15 to 71. So that was the beginning process of initiative being taken Now again, this is our clue. Our execution will probably take place somewhere near where we can get liquidity away and we want to be in ahead of the break and this is where the break occurs. Okay so we can see the break occurs just above that 92 and a half. Notice the whole bunch of stops on the break and continuation. Also notice the volume pick up as well as the delta Okay, so that's our second clue and again. I know I know it sometimes seems easy, but it is that easy guys You just have to learn to observe the clues from the markets rather than trying to anticipate rather than trying to second guess yourself Okay, you simply waiting for that clue back when that clues in you execute. Okay now What we're gonna do we're gonna have a look at one more example This is now in the gold again on the fifth of December again a five minute rotation Now this is the second strategy. So obviously we've spoken about the two types of execution. One is on the clue ahead of the break and we want to be in on the break. The second is then, once we've had a breakout, the first pullback. So we've identified a good breakout, we wait for that first pullback and we can see, very simply, obviously market has a nice exhaustion", "transcript": "Risk reward. Okay. This is probably hands down one of the best risk reward trades you can learn But only if you're willing to learn the clues. Okay, so we get the clue we try and execute wherever we best can probably within that absorption 320 contracts traded once we get the clue we short and i think the breakout came somewhere in and around that price we will obviously see that a little bit later on okay so that's our first example of a clue the next example is in the gold market this time obviously we have a little bit more of the traditional type flag breakout the one you're all familiar with and again i'm going to show hands down you know what's going on here was we could rarely see that little 163 lots so you can see if you compare it to what had gone on in the previous three rotations okay obviously these are five minute rotations so you can see nothing was going on no volume trading okay really really light volumes in terms of prices we're averaging what three four price ranges in terms of the Delta relatively positive cumulative wise nothing going on per we do Well, not just ten times the volume on the previous rotation but double what we've been doing on average over the last couple of rotations Okay, so there's your absorption 163 lots note one seller sold into him So you got filled so someone reloaded by a reloaded absorbed once the market picked up on it Notice a little bit of an imbalance here. Okay, so 11 goes to 18 0 goes to 39 Again another little imbalance 39 to 129 15 to 71. So that was the beginning process of initiative being taken Now again, this is our clue. Our execution will probably take place somewhere near where we can get liquidity away and we want to be in ahead of the break and this is where the break occurs. Okay so we can see the break occurs just above that 92 and a half. Notice the whole bunch of stops on the break and continuation. Also notice the volume pick up as well as the delta Okay, so that's our second clue and again. I know I know it sometimes seems easy, but it is that easy guys You just have to learn to observe the clues from the markets rather than trying to anticipate rather than trying to second guess yourself Okay, you simply waiting for that clue back when that clues in you execute. Okay now What we're gonna do we're gonna have a look at one more example This is now in the gold again on the fifth of December again a five minute rotation Now this is the second strategy. So obviously we've spoken about the two types of execution. One is on the clue ahead of the break and we want to be in on the break. The second is then, once we've had a breakout, the first pullback.

Okay so that would be our second entry point which would be that first pullback. Now note what I would say, what is very different, this is a rule of thumb okay, get rid of all the other understanding of, for instance, exhaustion, low and highs. Like I've said to you, every one of these trade strategies has to have some form of context. Now, a breakout trade strategy, by definition, is all about price discovery. Now, when a market goes into price discovery, it's not a one-off feature, because it's Yes, when that happens we have a failed support resistance, but more often than not a breakout We have the break we pull back and we're more than likely very high probability and always extend and continue the function of price Discovery okay, that's the key guys, right? If you know that if you know breakouts good breakouts will always form some form of price discovery you can execute once Early ahead of the break make good money take your profits on the exhaustion because you've learned that principle Sell the first pullback. Okay and hold on for the second extension two trades one strategy Okay. Now, let's take a look at one of the examples and the first example we're gonna look at will be from the Gold this is on the 27th of November Like I said obviously this is the breakout I was showing you on the board. Now I'm just going to fast forward it to that point so you can see what it looks like 163 lots. So all we're going to really focus on is this clue being provided. So again like I said note the variations nothing really going through the market really really light in terms of volume. Not a great deal going on. You see the market comes down and all of a sudden we start to see someone selling the bed okay this is what we call buying absorption all right and note where it's coming it's so important the buying absorption needs to come at the extreme point you know it's ahead of the break we don't want to see it down here on the candlestick chart okay we don't want to see it at the base of the uh consolidation area or distribution area we want to see it towards the", "transcript": "One is on the clue ahead of the break and we want to be in on the break.

Let's move on to our next example. This is going to be a breakout now in the cable again Remember, this is obviously mid-range so you can see how this is why it's crucial because I want to show you guys wanted to spell That idea that breakouts occur You know just extremes I don't they can extreme they can occur from anywhere And that's why we have the clues like you know price velocity shifting So so important you always do analysis. You always have those blue lines so that when that velocity shifts You can simply execute. So what you're gonna see are now is the cable is sitting in a relatively sideways range. Note, nothing going on, really low volume, nice light colors, zero change in the delta. We do however have a negative delta on the day. So there's quite a negative delta on the day, but prices are sitting quite close to the high of the day, which is quite fascinating. Now note what's just happened here. Straight away the markets come up and we've seen a relatively aggressive Buyer, okay. Now this is stuff. This is a real subtle clue because something's changed yet You know if I just saw this now be really switched on it doesn't necessarily in bio cell But something's changed because suddenly we've seen a buyer not just take 200 contracts But he's also then bought 123 so really really aggressive intent taken from a buyer Get what happens to price it goes in the opposite direction Okay, that was our subtle clue now. You're gonna see how this plays out of the next couple of minutes ultimately we start to see a little bit of an imbalance form in the middle of this rotation. These are obviously five-minute rotations, and suddenly we start to see the market move slightly lower and lower and lower. Okay, so we got the signal early on, and all of a sudden the market begins the process of initiative in the opposite direction. Okay, note the imbalances again. So we had imbalances higher up, imbalances lower down, and suddenly the market... Begins a very rapid process of Unwind okay, I just want to get back to that break point. So again, just note guys. It's it's not always that a breakout He's gonna be suddenly huge or big. Okay, obviously note we did have a little bit of an outside candle Okay, note the change in volume that the shift in Delta.

Spend a lot of time thinking about where does the initiative come in, where does the response have come in, where, you know, in a good breakout that gave a really big reward and a really big target, what was the early initiative like, was there any kind of response, what was the conditioning behind that interaction, and that's the real, the nuance behind not just the strategy, but all the strategies. Obviously, in terms of interaction, we expect aggressive interaction. Again, in terms of timing clues, these are the clues that you definitely want to look out for that we went over.
