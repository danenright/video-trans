There is a link that I want you to click on that explains you a little bit more in a little bit more detail of what an algorithm is, but with the power of the internet, depending on how far you want to go into this, you can really research into all the different dynamics, but effectively an algorithm operates really on the premise, if this, then that. If the 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day moving average, then it's going to purchase 50 bun contracts. Or as another scenario, if it moves above the 200-day moving average, when there's after that moving average has occurred, then you're going to be buying 60 contracts in the DAX market. So you can really put together a whole bunch of this then those then that scenarios in order to put the strategy in place and there's normally a testing system of that goes on with any development of any system where you does where you you have the hypothesis that you want to test and then you do the The the back testing then you then once the back testing is proven itself you go into design phase you Analyze it you you implement it and you experiment and that's effectively the the entire circle of developments for algorithmic systems and it's really important if you want to really investigate a little bit more just research into algorithmic systems but again it's the patterns that emanate from these systems that is really really important. So the types of algos you know are any algorithm that operates of certain types of events that occur as some algorithms wait for whenever the market trades above the VWAP or below the VWAP and you have all these sophisticated or very simple execution strategies and really it's these patterns and if we can observe them as traders we can really execute effectively. So look at that link, research a little bit more into it so you can get a really grounded understanding on what algorithms are but when you do research it, research it in the strategies on the price ladder and then how will you trade as a discretionary trader when you observe these various patterns that you see on the price ladder.", "transcript": "Okay, let's now define an algorithm.
