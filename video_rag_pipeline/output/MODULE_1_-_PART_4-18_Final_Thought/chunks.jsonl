I hope you've enjoyed the course and the way we've laid it out. More importantly, I hope you've grasped the basic understanding of volume profiling principles. In module two, we are going to continue with our principles except they're going to become a little bit more complex. We're then going to move on and develop very specific strategies based on the concepts we're going to teach you. Do note, we will follow the very same layout that we used in module 1, where we start with theoretical principles, we then move on to practical applications of those principles and finish with you applying those principles in the day-to-day markets and updating your very own playbook. Make sure you continually update that playbook every single day. By continually updating it, you're going to keep up with the markets, you're going to learn to observe the markets in a specific way, and more importantly you're going to have a reference point to come back to when you have specific patterns that you notice on a day-to-day basis. Every single day we are going to have live streams. A lot of these live streams are going to be covering the very principles you have learned in the volume profiling course. So make sure that you watch these live streams because you are going to see a host of different professional traders utilizing the market profile. So not only will you learn the principles that I have taught you, but you'll also learn how other professional traders apply those very same principles. Keep it simple, guys. Focus on getting that a little bit better every single day. Keep updating your playbook and make sure that whenever you find something unique added to that playbook, remember with strong discipline, very focused work ethic, patience and determination you will be successful. Good luck.", "transcript": "Congratulations on finishing the apprenticeship. I hope you've enjoyed the course and the way we've laid it out.
