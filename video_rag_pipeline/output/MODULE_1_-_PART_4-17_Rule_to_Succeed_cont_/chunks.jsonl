First and foremost, if you take a look at the picture, you can see the man climbing the stairs towards the top. Now whilst this is a simple analogy, it's crucial to understand these steps as these are steps of progression. and you only develop those skills through trial and error, through making mistakes, through highs and lows. So please understand that trading is an investment, it's a long-term adventure that you're taking. You cannot expect to be making millions in the first two or three years. Why? Well because you have to go through the natural steps of progression. Every skill you have to begin with the basics and constantly build upon those skills. And once you've built upon those skills, once you have the entire skill set and the knowledge and the understanding of the markets, then when the market presents you with unique opportunities, you can fully capitalize on those opportunities. That is where you begin to become successful as a trader. So what are the four basic rules that I feel are required to succeed in trading? Number one, discipline. You need to have discipline. be at your desk first thing in the morning, discipline to do your prep, discipline to do your aftermarket debriefing, discipline to practice some of the trades that you're doing, discipline to keep up to date. This is discipline in everything. If you're not disciplined in the basic elements of trading, in the elements that you can control, the market will not reward you. Not only will it not reward you, it will take from you. Make sure you discipline because you can control the discipline. Then work ethic very very crucial to make sure that you work hard Trading is not going to be easy. It's not a nine-to-five job. It's not a job where you can can just slack You're the only one that determines how much you make in this job You're the only one that determines how far you want to go in this job There's no one to push you so you have to be willing to work hard from day one Whenever you feel yourself slacking just remind yourself If you're not working hard enough, there's always someone else that's willing to work harder than you, and they will take the opportunity that you should be taking. Patience. You have to be patient as a trader. Not just patient in your level of progression, not just patient in how much you're learning, but patient to wait for the right kind of strategies that make sense to you as a trader.", "transcript": "Now that we've completed Module 1, I'd like to take a few moments just to go through what I feel are the rules to succeed in trading.
