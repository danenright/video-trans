Now we're going to talk a little bit about identifiers and again it's something I have spoken about on one of the periscopes before, but I really want to highlight and drive home the importance of identifiers and why we use them in professional trading. The questions you want to be asking yourself are what are identifiers? What are some of the basic identifiers that you'll be learning about and utilizing and why do we need these identifiers? So first up what is an identifier? Well it's simple it's a stencil okay it's a stencil that you apply to the markets daily which you will fill out in order to recognize patterns. All right now put more simply it's an exact created process to follow to determine Every single day you're going to follow a step-for-step process. You're going to fill out like an informational form and by doing that you're ultimately suddenly going to start to develop when there are deviations from what you expect. Okay now those expectations I'm going to teach you when we go through each one of the strategies. I'm going to show you what is the expectation, what should you be seeing, and you will then very quickly pick up when those deviations are occurring We follow certain identifiers every day okay to recognize pattern changes so that we can formulate new trade strategies All right, that's why we we don't stop following the identifiers We're always watching the identifiers to learn when potentially new patterns are developing now One of the best examples of an identify is volume, so let's Take for example, over the last 10 trading sessions, you've suddenly recognized that whenever the volume exceeds, say, 50,000 contracts, you've recognized that price tends to very aggressively fall or rise. Now if you've noticed this, you've recognized the pattern based on the identifier of if tomorrow or the day after suddenly you see 50,000 contracts come into the market, you know that you need to be getting onto that trend and following the market in the direction of price. And that's what the identifier is all about. It's all about you recognize a pattern based on the identifier, you understand, interpret, learn, create a strategy around that pattern so that when those identifiers crop up again, you simply just execute on the objective information. Okay, so what are some of the basic market identifiers? Firstly, volume. Volatility, stops, time, relative changes, as well as the delta.

We're going to extensively cover these in every single one of those chapters. Why do we need identifiers that that's probably the question on your mind, you know Well firstly to develop a consistent approach to view the markets and therefore develop a consistent strategy to execute in the market Right. That's what it all boils down to is that when we have an exact process, you've got to think of that exact process Like following a recipe in a cookbook Okay, if you follow the recipe from you know, number one to number ten the outcome is going to be favorable Okay, and that's the important thing, that's why we develop a consistent process or a consistent approach because it will then allow us to develop consistent strategies, but more importantly consistent performance. Now one of the biggest fallacies I find in trading is that you need multiple approaches What I'm going to tell you now, and I'm going to reiterate this when we get to the strategy section, you only need one strategy, guys. You only need to be successful at one strategy. The example I always use, and I mention, is if you look at the likes of Apple as a company, Apple is extremely successful, they are one of the wealthiest companies Apple produces the same iPhone X in the same workshop, with the same process, with the same tools, same machinery, and it takes the same amount of time. Everything is the same. They simply follow a step-for-step process to develop the iPhone X. Now it's no different for us as traders. We simply have to follow a process step-for-step-for-step. The whole art to trading is to find one or two strategies, really master them and leverage them up. Just like Apple does, they leverage up the amount of products they're producing with one simple process.

The second point is that we have a very conclusive template that will ultimately allow us to move ourselves from making unconscious errors to making unconscious corrections.

But the template ultimately follows a very chronological order from firstly observing the necessary conditions for a strategy to exist in, then identifying the strategy, which I'll be teaching you one of the ten, and then lastly the execution in a dynamic manner of that strategy with key focus on trade management. Let's view each one of these sections on its own and have a look at some of the identifiers within each section. So under the observation, we have two sub-indexes. The first is obviously pre-context and pre-condition. So this is the state that you want to find the market, it's the market conditioning or the trade location or the market context.

Obviously, these will be effectively the strategy identifiers or the characteristics of each strategy.

So what identifiers can we utilize to ensure we're effectively executing? And those will include things like entry, timing of execution, stop placement, target placement, risk reward, as well as leveraging and how to leverage.

You are going going to fill it in with me, then at the end of each strategy unit, you know, when we do the live example again, you're going to fill it out. And then when I give you your drill sessions, you're going to fill out another one. So for every single one of the 10 strategies, you're going to fill out one form. And every time you find that strategy in the live market or when you're practicing the drill, you're going to fill it out again and again and again. So you're going to become, by the end of the course, you're going to fill out a lot of these templates, but you're going to recognize how important and how valuable the templating is.

You're not writing down, you know, anything other than the facts that you're extracting from the market. So I'm going to show you how to complete the template and ultimately extract the facts from the market and then how to make decisions based on those facts. Now, important, you can apply this to any time frame. It doesn't matter what time frame you're trading within, it doesn't matter if you're trending or not. You can do it over a market that's been trading for the last three days or a market that's been trading for the last couple of minutes. This can be applied to any one of the 10 strategies in any time frame. The first thing we need to look at and as you can see in front of you, this is the strategy observation section. Now you can very clearly see on the left side on the left box we've got market context and on the right box we've got market conditioning. Now these are the two sub-indexes of strategy observation. Now bear in mind as I mentioned earlier this is nothing more than the the preconditioning of the market in which we want to trade because this is the prime within. Now the first thing you're going to do is let's say you've you've observed strategy number six, you know, absorption and auctioning. The first thing you're going to do now is come and complete the question. So the first thing is, is it is the market trending or is it consolidating? And you'll simply circle it. Then is the market balanced or imbalanced? and you'll circle it. Then the trade location, where are we trading? We're trading in the previous day's value area, we're trading at the extremes or we're trading outside of the range. Where are we trading in terms of price? So that will give us a little bit of understanding about the market context. Then in terms of market conditioning, we want to talk a little bit about what are the time frame participants. What are we seeing? Are we seeing a lot of noise from algorithms, are we seeing large big orders come into the market, or are we just seeing a lot of passive, you know, responsive type orders coming into the market. So that's what we'll talk about in terms of time frame participants. In terms of liquidity, is there a lot of liquidity, are the market conditions quite thin? And then volatility, is there volatility or not? Okay, so once you've done that, you've effectively completed the first part of the template, which is the strategy observation.

By doing this every single day you're going to very quickly recognize when for instance a breakout trade works well or when a hiding behind the elephant trade strategy works well. Just by doing this you're going to very quickly learn to understand the prime conditions. And ultimately what that's going to lead to is you're going to recognize when there's higher probability conditions and when there's lower probability conditions in play. Now on the next slide we're going to identify what are some of the identifiers you need to recognize to show you that your trade strategy is in play. Now this is the second section to the template that you're going to complete and this is effectively the strategy identification. So these are the identifiers that you will need to recognize in order for one of the ten strategies to be in play. The first thing to look at is the two subsections, which is interaction and then the metrics. In terms of interaction, we're going to focus on was the initiative or responsive type of price action, was the passive or aggressive type of price action. So it's the real interaction between the buyers and sellers that we're going to focus on. Then we're going to talk a bit about metrics, some of the metrics we're going to focus a lot of attention on in the template is volume, time, the delta, the cumulative delta, as well as the relative changes. Once you've observed this interaction and the metrics, you will learn the interaction required for the chosen strategy to work well, as well as the accompanying metrics We're going to then move on to the execution part of the template in the next slide. So the third section of the template is all about strategy execution. Again, the two sub-sections will include money management as well as the application or the decision-making process. Now some of the factors to consider or the identifiers we're going to consider with passive or aggressive execution, risk stop placement, you know, target placement as well as the risk reward.

And then in terms of the application side, you know, timing, whether we're preemptive or exact, as well as leveraging or better known as pyramiding. Now, again, as mentioned in the previous slides, the whole reason we do this is that over time through completing this, you're going to learn what the best methodologies for execution are based on each strategy. For example, sometimes people pyramid without permitting in the right time, and they type of trade strategy and ultimately all this does is skew the risk and destroy the probability of success. So this template is going to allow you to determine when do you want to leverage, when do you not want to, when do you need to be aggressive in your execution, when do you need to be passive. Let's view the template in its entirety before we close out the unit. So on the right side of the slide you can see pretty much what the template looks like Obviously by this stage. Hopefully you've downloaded it if you haven't it is provided for you on the LMS system now The first thing is I just want to briefly go through some of the elements that weren't spoken about The first is the first section which you can see at the top of the template and you can see that obviously it says the trade strategy so First thing is, write down what is the trade strategy. You can write it down or you can select it from one of the 10 boxes. Circle it. Nice and easy. Circle the strategy. But then more importantly, go and draw the strategy. This is so crucial. As human beings, our brains tend to hold on to picture images a lot easier than text. go draw it, use different colors, annotate it, personalize it, really make it your own drawing that way you're going to remember it a lot easier. Now do note obviously every time we do one of the 10 strategies you're going to fill this out. Every time you recognize one of the 10 strategies in the marketplace whilst practicing I urge you to complete it, you know it is there for your benefit ultimately. If we go to the bottom part of the template, you'll notice three boxes in the bottom left. Now, don't worry if you can't see it here, obviously you will have an A4 PDF page of this document. But in the bottom left hand side, there's three things written there, and that's what I call the accountability section. Now, it includes the time, the habit slash 30, and a sign. And all this is saying is that firstly, write down the time. How long did it take you to complete this?", "transcript": "will include money management as well as the application or the decision-making process. Now some of the factors to consider or the identifiers we're going to consider with passive or aggressive execution, risk stop placement, you know, target placement as well as the risk reward. And then in terms of the application side, you know, timing, whether we're preemptive or exact, as well as leveraging or better known as pyramiding. Now, again, as mentioned in the previous slides, the whole reason we do this is that over time through completing this, you're going to learn what the best methodologies for execution are based on each strategy. For example, sometimes people pyramid without permitting in the right time, and they type of trade strategy and ultimately all this does is skew the risk and destroy the probability of success. So this template is going to allow you to determine when do you want to leverage, when do you not want to, when do you need to be aggressive in your execution, when do you need to be passive.

The reason being is that a lot of you are going to find this rather monotonous and time consuming initially, but if you write this out every single time, you're going to very quickly realise how quick you can get at completing this. Obviously, it says habit slash 30, again, if you want to get good at completing this and you want to develop real habits with this template, you know, write out the days. How many days out of 30 have you completed this? Again, I urge you to try it for a 30-day period, write day one, day two, day three, every single time you complete it, you know, complete and build that habit through Then the last is signing off and this is crucial, this is signing off that you've done a complete debrief and you've done it to the best of your knowledge and you're giving it your stamp approval. It's so important you do this, again you might think it's silly but it really does hold you accountable to completing the document. Do note, guys, that habits take time to form. What I am going to say is if you want to get good at this template and you really want to build consistency in your trading, you're going to need to complete this every day. Now, don't worry, like I said to you, there is no right or wrong, okay? This is a situation of the perfect imperfection where, you know, you might want to initially write down everything perfectly and try and get every answer right and perfectly get it right, but it's not about being perfect. It's just about forcing you to think, forcing you to write down your fact-based observations. And over time, you know, if you write these down, eventually you're going to become at your trading even though you were doing imperfect observation analysis. Okay and then obviously you know motivation is a crucial part I know it can be time-consuming so just remain you know motivated keep reminding yourself of the big picture which is that if I do this for 30 days I build consistency I become profitable and I get one step closer to my dream of becoming a professional trader. And then last if you do miss one, it's okay All right Don't don't put a backlog of days that you need to fill out skip it move on to the next one Let bygones be bygones. Okay, don't don't hang on to all the old forms to complete Otherwise what's gonna end up happening is you're just gonna create anxiety You're gonna feel stressed rather than actually getting on with the job at hand now Note, you will get quicker over time. Guaranteed, take this from where it comes, from experience, you will get quicker at filling this out over time.", "transcript": "But in the bottom left hand side, there's three things written there, and that's what I call the accountability section.
