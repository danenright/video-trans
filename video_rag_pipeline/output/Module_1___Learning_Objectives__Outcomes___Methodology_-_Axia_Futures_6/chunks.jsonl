And then building the trading strategies really is one of the most exciting parts. We already started looking at how we can execute the trade once we've observed the Pacific order flow pattern and so we looked at the method of execution and You'll see as we go out through each part of the course We have a very structured approach and with that structured your approach You can use that very that exact same approach in your own learning on a daily basis So we look at the method of execution Then we look at how we going to manage the order flow trade So once we execute the trade given the Pacific price ladder pattern that we've seen how are we going to? actually manage the trade once we enter it. What are we looking at? What are we looking at from an order flow environment? What are we looking at from assessing the various volume components that are coming to the market? What are we doing once we enter the trade and the trade changes its dynamics? So really the management is so quickly important especially from a self-awareness And really one of the most important parts is the risk and size manipulation. One of the biggest things that I've observed in my almost 12 years of being on the trading floors is really seeing that the best traders are the ones who understand how to manipulate their size. And we really look at this in great detail on the course because a lot of traders who just have a very static, undynamic approach to managing your size, don't last in this game very long. If they do last, they don't become the best that they can be as traders, because you can train traders, you know, which direction the markets could potentially go. And, you know, you could be right to wrong 50% of the time, but the great traders can be literally right 5 to 10% of the time, but because they know how to manipulate their size at the right time, So incredibly effective because they are so well skilled in how to manage their size So this is really important part of when we look at the various order flow Patterns and I really want you to develop that skill set because it's a skill set that doesn't get spoken about much in the Marketplace and it's a skill set that you can deploy the best when you are a price ladder trader", "transcript": "Okay, then in the next module is building trading strategies or the next part of the learning process.
