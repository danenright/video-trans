We're going to talk about composite volume profiling. So what is a composite profile? A traditional profile is made up of one day of data. However, sometimes we wish to have a flexible profile that can illustrate an auction that Any profile that is made up of several parts or multiple profiles can be deemed a composite profile. What is important is not the definition but rather the implications. So very simply, traditionally a volume profile is one day. but you can take any say half an hour section of the day you can take a couple of days, you can take a couple of months and create a volume profiling. The principle of volume profiling is to try and illustrate where trade has been facilitated over a given period. So any period that isn't a day is a composite profile. So why do we use these composite profiles well very simply firstly it ensures we constantly understand the bigger picture So it gives us a top-down approach. What do we mean by that well if we look at say a monthly volume profile We will see effectively how volume has been distributed over price and time over an entire month So it gives us a good bigger term perspective of what has actually gone on over the period of a month Then, markets have long-term memory, so again, sometimes we use these composite profiles to develop very unique strategies based on weekly and monthly charts. Why? Because, well, you might, as a day trader, you might remember a certain level and forget about it after a few days, but if you go back and you look on say a weekly or monthly volume profile, you will notice that that area may stick out and the market tends Then, as mentioned before, markets tend to respect previously accepted long term high volume errors. In other words, a series of prices that has been accepted as fair value by the market that should tend to be revisited at some point in the future and maybe even become fair price again. Also, composite profiles that can illustrate to us where high probability trade location may be. So if, for instance, over a period of a couple of days and weeks we've seen that the market has been accepting a lot of value and then suddenly shoots away from value, we can pick up where good trade location would be just using composite profiles. Also, Composite Profiles illustrate the long term auction process quite nicely.", "transcript": "Welcome to the theoretical principle based part of part 9.
