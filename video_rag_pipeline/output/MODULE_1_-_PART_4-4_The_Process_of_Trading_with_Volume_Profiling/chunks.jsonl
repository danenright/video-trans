We're now going to just do a very basic step-for-step process on how you can use volume profiling within your trading. So how do we go about it? First and foremost, when you approach volume profiling, the first thing you need to As you will recall, we did this in the playbook at the end of part 3. So first things first, find a market you like, have a look at that market and break it down or complete the template based on the volume profile metrics. Once you have completed that, you then need to do a subjective and objective analysis. We will do an example in the future, later in part four, so not to worry if you're not too sure about an objective versus subjective analysis. Once you've completed the subjective objective analysis, you will then identify the volume profile anomalies. By doing this basic three-step process, you are on path ready to develop a key strategy with using market volume profiles. So let's take a look now at a practical example illustrating the power of profiling as a tool as well as a very basic profiling strategy we can implement. In Module 2 and 3 we will go further in depth with profiling principles, building further upon the basics we have established in Module 1. We will also develop a host of profiling strategies and your personalized market profiling playbook.", "transcript": "We're finally getting to the fun part of the module.
