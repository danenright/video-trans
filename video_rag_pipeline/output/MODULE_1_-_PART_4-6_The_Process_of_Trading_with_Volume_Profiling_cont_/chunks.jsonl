So as you can see, to do a subjective analysis on the previous example, we could say a number of things. One, the market should break out. Note how, yes, there's a high probability the market does move away from this value area that it's been consolidating in for the last number of days, however, it's not to say that it will break out. If we say that the anomaly is likely to get filled, yes of course we know anomalies tend to eventually get filled or that bad quadruple top TPO eventually will be taken out. That's not to say it will do it today. This is merely an idea or an opinion. Also if we say once we break out of range momentum is expected. Whilst this is or there is a high probability based on tuition that this could occur, it's not necessarily a fact. And being stuck in this frame of mind of the market should and could do something could land you in a very strong bias which ultimately will lead to losses. Let's look then on the other side and see what objectivity means. That's an objective statement. Why? Because we can see this market has been overlapping value areas for the last three sessions in a row. This is very very unusual. The fact that we are overlapping suggests that we are consolidating. The fact that we also have a lot of overlap between the open close price as well as a very similar point of control on each one in three days again suggests that we are consolidating. All three of these together are very factual Then, a rejection top is a pivot. Again we know that when there is a tail in the market, the market tends to very quickly auction away from this point. Noting that this is a pivot and a very important area in the market is again being very objective and this will allow us to remain in an objective state of mind. The stop placement above the tail high. Allowing ourselves to execute in this manner will ensure that we will remain objective. And last but not least, a low volume area anomaly. Stating a fact is remaining objective. There is a low volume area which the market has very quickly auctioned away from. This is an objective fact. So again, the key highlights. It's important to note the following. Subjectivity gives us the idea and feeling. Objectivity gives us the confirmation to execute on that idea. By doing a basic objective versus subjective test we can very quickly determine when we are trading objectively or being biased by our subjective opinion.", "transcript": "Let's go back to the step 2 and do an objective versus subjective analysis of the previous example we've just spoken about.
