If you want to be successful at this trade strategy, you've got to follow a very Now, first and foremost, just bear in mind, when we get volatility expansion, All this implies, it doesn't mean necessarily that we're going to trend. I think that's a big mistake a lot of traders make. Volatile expansion does not imply trend. What it does imply is that we get much larger, you know, non-directional, all-directional moves. In other words, if suddenly you get an engulfing day, there is a high probability that you're going to get continued range expansion. More important, if you are used to the rotations in your market being, say, you know, 10 prices and then 10 prices and then 10 prices, you can now expect that to double or even triple to doing maybe 20 and 30 and 40. So you get much bigger rotational moves in the market as a result of the engulfing nature. So that's important to understand. When we go through this trade setup, there's a few key things and key characteristics that you want to pay attention to. First and foremost, you need to identify the previous day's close. The previous day's close is pivotal. If we close beyond the range of, you know, in the example of an engulfing profile, if we close beyond the range of the previous day, in other words, if that's our profile, and we close either above or below the previous day's range, that is relatively a strong signal as to early sentiment the next day. Note what I said, early sentiment, not necessarily early directional play. So again, when you see this day type where we get an extreme type close, there is a very high probability that the market will at least test the previous day's extreme within the very early opening time frame of the market. So again, the close is important in terms of the engulfing value area, again, similar.

Now as we go through this example, I'm gonna explain to you the characteristics and the execution style based on the various strategies. So, first and foremost, you can be sure that if you execute, in other words, if we have an extreme close as we did in this example, if we were to illustrate this, if I can bring, in fact, let's pause this and I can bring you into context. So, what happened on the previous day was we effectively, the market opened relatively sort of neutral. We then attempted to move aggressively higher and the market very quickly moved distributing and then distributing twice. So a very, very, very aggressive sell-off off the top. The market showed some real initiative once we tested that high point. So again, we saw some real strong initiative taken from these sellers. More importantly, we then settled and closed towards a low. So let's continue this now and see what the market does in the early attempt. As we can see, the previous day's close was the 109.55 with a low print of 109.40. Now as you can see, the market's opened in and around the previous day's low and it's distributing. It's looking for a lot of two-way trade. Don't forget, when we do open around the previous day's low outside of the value error, we are in effect opening out of balance. So the market is a little bit skewed in terms of its balance. Now the first and most important characteristic to understand is the break of the previous day's low. Okay, so the break of the previous day's or not necessarily low, but previous low or high is the key in determining what sort of a day type you are going to get. Now, if we get an initiative break, so we get an initiative break where we get single prints and a low volume area and real strong aggressive like we're seeing here, okay? If we get that initiative and the initiative holds, then there is a high likelihood that the market is going to continue with the short term trend and you can be relatively aggressive. However, this is not the highest probability outcome. What usually occurs the day after an engulfing profile is we usually get a drift type pattern lower.

Now there's a very important reason as to why this occurs and why it occurs so often. Again, it reverts back to the psychology of what has occurred the previous day. So, cast your mind back to the previous day. We had a move up and the market very aggressively, sellers stepped into the market and more importantly they forced buyers to liquidate, so buyers liquidated and buyers liquidated. Now what you have to say to yourself is we saw the initiative substantially higher Fresh sellers, initiative fresh sellers are unlikely to be as aggressive going forward. Why? Because they've already positioned themselves short. In other words, what's taking this market lower and below the previous days low is buyers that are liquidating or that are caught offside liquidating their position. So it's an unwind of the longs that got caught out as a result of the extreme volatility. We can see anyone that's caught long still tries to liquidate those positions and they sell out, and that is what creates the fresh leg lower. We then see a little bit of short-term reprieve as the buyers stop selling so aggressively, and we get a little bit of a bounce until the sellers then initiate again, and it continues over the course of the day. after a day where we have engulfing profiles or value areas. So again, straight away you've got to say to yourself, if there is a high probability that this is the type of price response you're going to get, then you need to execute in a very specific manner. And that manner is simple. We do not want to be firstly looking to buy the market in this example, but more importantly we want to be looking to sell into any kind of short-term momentum That is the key we don't want to be aggressive to the short side We don't want to be selling lower prices But we want to sell it into any attempt at a weak up move as we know there are a lot of longs that still You know that are still trapped that are still trying to get out that will still keep executing on any move higher Let's now turn our attention and have a look at how this played out on the chart.

So again, put yourself in the frame of mind of if I was a buyer at this point, what would it have felt like? It would have felt uncomfortable. You would have had to sit there for almost three timeframes or an hour and a half just for the market to start to rotate higher. Yes, it did rotate higher, but the key thing is that one of the characteristics of an engulfing profile or the day after is that it's a more difficult trade to be on the wrong side. So if the short term or the engulfing was to the downside, we don't want to be buyers. Likewise, if it was an engulfing to the upside, we don't want to be sellers.

This is nothing more than a normal distribution. It's normally distributing outside of the previous day's range, but effectively, we are still just finding their value over a wider range of prices, and that is the key, is that engulfing just means volatility, and volatility just means an expansion over the number of prices that we distribute.
