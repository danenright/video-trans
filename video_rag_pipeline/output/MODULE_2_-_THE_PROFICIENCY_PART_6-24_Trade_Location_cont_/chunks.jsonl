With a basic profile drawing on the left, you can see the market opens between the two lines which is depicting the value area. You can see when the market opens within the previous day's value area, within balance, we tend to spend a lot of the initial trade auctioning out the previous day's value area. Straight away, just looking at this basic example, when we open in value, in range, Even using the volume profile example, you can see how much the market the next day actually traded within the previous day's value area. Now note just a few observations. When we are in value, in range, we are firmly in balance, so we get a lot of overlapping TPO, a lot of overlapping price, a lot of two-way trade. Note, the day's range is likely, in other words, the next day's range when we open in value is likely to be very, very similar to the previous day's range with maybe potential for a slight extension. So straight away when we're opening in balance in value, the day's range today is likely to be similar to the previous day's range. Again, knowing something as simple as this will keep you from being too aggressive too aggressive from looking for big potential winners. And then note once the extreme point is determined, we can then establish what the potential range will be for the day. So if you utilized one of the topping out patterns that we spoke about earlier, then once that top has been formed or we get a little bit of an excess tail, you can then identify what the potential range is or what the potential opportunity is that you can take advantage of.", "transcript": "So let's look now at each one of these three trade opens or trade locations that we spoke about.
