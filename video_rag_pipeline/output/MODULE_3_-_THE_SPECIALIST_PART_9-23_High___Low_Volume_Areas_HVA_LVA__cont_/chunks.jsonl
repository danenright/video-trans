Now remember, a high volume area is not a value area, it's a series of prices that is attracting the most trade over time or over volume. Now in this example we can see two distinct high volume areas, one at the low and one at the high. you want to trade toward a high volume area. So when a market is distributing as it is in this example there's a high likelihood it's going to trade between high volume areas. So once price shows movement towards the high volume area we want to then initiate trade to retest the high volume area. So for example we can see the market is trading up towards the high in this example. Once the market shows that its you know, sellers have entered, we're seeing some sell side action we then want to trade this trade back down towards the lower of the high volume notes or high volume areas. Now note, remember what I said to you, this is not an exact concept expect a lot of overlap, expect a lot of two-way trade But the principle remains that trade should facilitate toward the low of the high volume areas. This is our example of a high volume area.", "transcript": "So in the example provided, you can see two very distinct high volume areas.
