And we're going to be looking at a few of the strategies. First Annotem, and then we'll look at an actual example that happened in the Bund contract. So firstly, let's just have a look. to the right hand side over here, which being the bull market. Now, firstly, let's look at a really explain through annoting on this ladder what the various trading strategies are and then we'll look at one of these trading strategies in real time. So firstly, the Now the false offer block, it's the objective of the layered spoofer is to create an artificial offer in the market. So what you're trying to do over here is all of these orders over here, they might be larger than average and might seem larger than all of the bids. So for example, 300 lots, 400 lots, 400 lots, 400 lots, and 400 lots, at every single price, over here, over here, over here. And really representing that's almost twice as large as the offer, I mean, sorry, as large as the bid. And if you refer to the slide, we've mentioned that the objective of the trader is to observe this false offer. by identifying the lack of relative trading activity going through on the bid. Bids are being pulled until there is a liquidity collection point bucket. So what we mean by that is as the market offers down, all these bids are not really real. So out of 313 lots, only say 50 lots get traded. 50 lot to get traded. So this gets pulled. Most of the orders, the buy side orders are pulled. So they pull the order, they pull the order, they pull the order, they pull the order because the market is seeking an area where it will find liquidity, where the market will start auctioning again. So when the market isn't auctioning at in one direction at quite a rapid rate whilst all the buy side orders get pulled and then the trading opportunities is once all the pulling has happened and what I mean by pulling is when you have a certain size but not all that size gets traded and only a very small fraction of that size gets traded that's effectively what you call pulling the bid. so the market trades all the way down as the as the offers are Looking large, but they're not about might be real office but it's more the bits getting pulled and as the market trades down and it offers down offers down offers down offers down and Then when it finds that point where there's all of a sudden two-way flow and the market is actually trading so all of a sudden you see for example over here this 178 lot", "transcript": "Okay, welcome to the video section of looking of how to employ different types of trading strategies when you observe market flipping, spoofing or layering.

So potential flip on the play, so you go on the opposite side. of the of the order now the reason why you've identified this as potentially not a front-run order is just the nature of the auctioning activity that's going around in the market and low liquidity you know fairly thin conditions and lippy price action where markets not trading um you know not auctioning at specific prices Yes, okay, we're watching it twice for you so you can see now getting so we just got just got filled at the 39 So as you got folded the 39 200 lot got taken so turn a lock got taken But then the market reloaded itself, so it's reloaded, so potential very intraday timeframe at this price, a particular type of iceberg pattern or volume slice pattern, absorption, you know, overall absorption pattern going on here.

So that is, you know, the nature and requirements of the flip pattern is when you see the large order, just below the large order, or below, you know, prices below the large order, you're gonna see a reloading of the prices on the opposite side of the large order.

Now you see, now it's just flipped. So it just traded out towards 42s and then another order has come on the book. So now this is on the opposite side. So we had it on the opposite, now on the buyer side. Now I want you to see if this is, you know, a flipper that's coming to the market. potentially now we want to be trading on the offer side, if we see the offers reloading themselves. So if all of a sudden the offer starts taking out the 42 and it reloads itself, you could see a flip in the other direction. So let's see how this now plays. So we're watching over here. We're trying to get out of our trade. We'd start going short. to go against the flip, and there we go. So that 1,000 lot that was non-genuine, now we're flipping the other way. So you've just observed with the 500 lot getting long, below the 500 lot when they were shown on the offer, when there was that 1,000 lot on the bid, you're then getting short to start exiting on the other side.

We can see any more reloading and over here there's just a little bit of a scalp and as we can see in that little moment the flippers disappeared but there was an opportunity to make between between those two flips between three to seven ticks in a very short period of time just working an order book pattern by observing thin conditions low liquidity conditions and seeing an anomaly large orders come in and seeing absorption on the opposite side of that large order once for the flip to happen. So just to summarize, we've just looked at the type of loan range of play. I explained right at the beginning of the video what a false author block looks like, what a false bid block looks like.
