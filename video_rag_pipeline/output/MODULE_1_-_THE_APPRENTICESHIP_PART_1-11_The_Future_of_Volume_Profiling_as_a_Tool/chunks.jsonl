Well, in order to understand the future, we need to look at what various tools have done in the past. Now, you go back a couple of years, and traditional tools like moving averages, Fibonacci However, with the advent of algorithms, nowadays these sorts of trade strategies are very heavily utilized by algorithms, and they're very good in the execution in the sense that they've now crowded out most of the retail trades, and that's why a lot of the time these trades like the 50% for Benachi and these trend lines, they don't work as well as However, with volume profiling, because it's not an exact tool where there's exact execution methodology, the algorithms cannot utilize the strategies we're going to show you that effectively and that easily. For that reason, volume profiling has got a long future ahead of it. Then, volume profiling focuses very heavily on money management. Now, because of this very reason, this is why a lot of people will continue to use it. Because it's an exact approach where you know where you're getting in, you know where you're getting out, you know where your risk lies. Because of that reason, volume profiling will remain a very, very sort of chosen Edge is self-created with volume profiling as you assign strategy to a set precondition. So what this is telling us is that because we are being very exact with our strategies using volume profiling, we can therefore develop Edge. So basically, because we're developing real Edge as a result of using volume profiling, More importantly, because you can continue to develop various strategies using volume profiling, you will continue to develop not just one edge, but various edges. Then, success is not as dependent on its users as it relies on the response of institutional, influential participants compared to Fibonacci. So what we're trying to say here is that back in the day, a lot of trading tools used to be successful simply because For instance the Fibonacci. Back in the day the 61.8 was very very popular simply because everyone used to trade the retracement of that you know key retracement and because of that it became a self-fulfilling prophecy that that trade worked. Nowadays however it doesn't work so well. However, with volume profiling, it's not as dependent on the users that use it. Why?", "transcript": "So, what does the future of volume profiling look like?

Because volume profiling, in essence, is forward-looking information, so as the information is being fed into the market, it drags in various longer-term timeframe participants, and it's this that creates some of the very, very big moves we see in the markets. Therefore, because it's forward-looking, it implies that the volume profiling will continue to progress as a tool and be utilized into the future. Then, volume profiling is not a trading system, nor is it predictive. Note, it's not exact, it's not buy your sell your. It's merely a principle-based approach where we're looking to engage in various strategies Volume profiling allows you to observe structure as the market is unfolding that structure and that enables accurate interpretation of which time frame is in control of market movement. It therefore uncovers vital information and clues that help unravel strength and weakness in the market momentum. So in other words guys, because volume profiling is giving us so much important vital information, it will remain a preferred tool so long as it continues to provide us with this information. Last but not least, volume profiling takes what is ultimately very complex in terms of a lot of movement, a lot of different tools, a lot of information and it all puts it into one simplified chart.
