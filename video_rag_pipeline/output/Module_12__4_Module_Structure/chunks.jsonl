Remember, as long as we put a solid structure and a solid approach so your brain understands what it's looking for, the road ahead, you are therefore building a very routine base of learning and knowing how to retrieve the right information given the right market conditions. So let's now have a look at how we're going to structure the rest of this module. They're going to be three learning videos, those learning videos will be looking at the trade idea, the trade strategy, behind the momentum, price at a play that we're looking at, how are we going to deploy the right strategies, and they're going to be... five drills, five of those drills where we will be really asking you questions and then giving you the feedback. There will be a Q&A session and that's really in conjunction with the drill. There will be three strategies that we look at in the momentum plane and participating in the live markets and trading accordingly and then we look really at the optimum market environment for these plays the volume the velocity the liquidity of the ladder and the auctioning level. So ideally, you know, if you look in a volume slam dunk play, which we're looking at later on, you want really strong volume, strong velocity, strong liquidity, strong auctioning level. So all of a sudden the green lights are flashing. That's the type of environment you want. If it is just a stop hunt, it doesn't really matter what type of environment you have because it's just going to be a critical inflection point where the market shifts up or shifts down very aggressively because stops unravel in the marketplace.", "transcript": "Okay, now we're going to be looking at the module structure.
