This is then the second of our counter-trend trade strategies. Do note It is obviously a footprint standalone trade strategy, we don't require any other trading tools to observe and execute it. It's also very much passive in terms of execution, we can wait for exact price before executing. As you can see in the slide, we're going to focus again on a number of principles. Some of the standout principles that we're going to really sort of reinforce again in this strategy session is obviously one, market context, two, high and low volume with particular focus on low volume areas or imbalances, and then three also, we're going to revisit the key concept of color lines and why they're so important. to the next of our strategy sessions onto the blackboard. So this strategy is probably one of my more favorite strategies.

The important thing what I want to try and bring across is that through time guys through looking at this this approach and understanding the principles better and viewing more and more of examples what's ultimately going to happen is you're going to develop a process at this point that is going to lead you in time to developing a far more consistent result based approach.

If you can adopt this process, if we can get to the end of Unit 15 and you kind of have that light bulb moment where you go, Aha, okay, I'm actually starting to execute in a more objective manner now, then ultimately my goal as a mentor has been achieved. Okay, so that's pretty much what that entire, you know, career timeline was about. So again, you know, write that down somewhere, you know, it's not too late now, we still got quite a few different strategies to go, but I really, really want you to move away from having a subjective approach, having a, it should go down because of this or that, and move more to a, this is there, therefore I can execute in this manner, okay. So the failed break of support and resistance now, like I said, I was always a bit more of a contrarian I always believed that most breakouts were fake and failed and I had to learn the hard way that some of them actually do Continue. However along the way I learned some Objective facts, you know some some analysis which I'm going to show you on the footprint a few key Identifiers that ultimately you can utilize to observe when actually yes a failed break of support and resistance is in play and we ultimately now have a good risk raw trade opportunity. Okay, so the first thing to identify is ultimately the variation and there is in only one variation. I'm going to start by just drawing it in essence, okay. In this example I'm going to use resistance, obviously it could be support as well and this resistance. Okay now later on towards the end of the course we are going to focus predominantly on breakout trade strategy and how we utilize the footprint but in essence what the breakout should look like and again I will cover this in detail when we get to that section is ultimately the break. Obviously we're seeing an initiative at the high now we know initiative should be accompanied in this example this context with definitely an imbalance. Okay, so we're first going to see an imbalance or ie light Delta Okay, and then we're going to run into some liquidity. Okay liquidity", "transcript": "based approach.

Okay liquidity another word for liquidity will simply just be some Passive absorption or responsive. Okay, and the minute we run into that Responsive we're going to see the colors go a little bit darker. Okay, so that's in essence what a breakout looks like now Before we can actually get onto the trade strategy of a failed break of support and resistance, we have to learn to identify what is support and resistance. And again, you know, we went through this principle in great detail. You know, there's too much subjectivity in the marketplace about what exactly is support and resistance. So again, I'm going to give you an objective way of understanding, is there actually a support there or is there Okay, so the first and most important thing is you're going to have to learn to observe when there is actually key support and resistance. Now, the manner in which to do this, it's very simple. Okay, one you need to lean on the facts, okay, and the facts are going to come in the break. Alright, so you're going to observe the break. That's how you determine whether or not this is a key support or resistance. Okay, we discussed that as one of the principles. So when we break here, okay We want to see an imbalance or we want to see a low volume area In other words, not a great deal volume being traded. Okay, we also want to see potentially some stops or imbalances Okay, so either are or okay. Now what do we mean by that is ultimately stops? We've noted we'll see zero. So we want to see maybe a zero zero times ten times 100 again it all depends these numbers obviously all depend on the market you're trading maybe times 200 but ideally we either want to see some stops or we want to see some form of an imbalance okay now why the question is you know well And then before we actually move on, I'll move on to the why now. And then we also want to see volatility, okay. So if we've been trading in say, you know, five tick ranges or eight tick ranges, we want to see this impulse move. We want to see the range really expand there. We want to see, you know, the buyers really step in and get stuck in and get their work done. Then the most important thing is once we do run into this liquidity being provided, we want to see the pullback being shallow, okay. are very, very important. Why? Because if it's a genuine breakout, a breakout by definition", "transcript": "break. Obviously we're seeing an initiative at the high now we know initiative should be accompanied in this example this context with definitely an imbalance. Okay, so we're first going to see an imbalance or ie light Delta Okay, and then we're going to run into some liquidity. Okay liquidity another word for liquidity will simply just be some Passive absorption or responsive. Okay, and the minute we run into that Responsive we're going to see the colors go a little bit darker. Okay, so that's in essence what a breakout looks like now Before we can actually get onto the trade strategy of a failed break of support and resistance, we have to learn to identify what is support and resistance. And again, you know, we went through this principle in great detail. You know, there's too much subjectivity in the marketplace about what exactly is support and resistance. So again, I'm going to give you an objective way of understanding, is there actually a support there or is there Okay, so the first and most important thing is you're going to have to learn to observe when there is actually key support and resistance. Now, the manner in which to do this, it's very simple. Okay, one you need to lean on the facts, okay, and the facts are going to come in the break. Alright, so you're going to observe the break. That's how you determine whether or not this is a key support or resistance. Okay, we discussed that as one of the principles. So when we break here, okay We want to see an imbalance or we want to see a low volume area In other words, not a great deal volume being traded. Okay, we also want to see potentially some stops or imbalances Okay, so either are or okay. Now what do we mean by that is ultimately stops? We've noted we'll see zero. So we want to see maybe a zero zero times ten times 100 again it all depends these numbers obviously all depend on the market you're trading maybe times 200 but ideally we either want to see some stops or we want to see some form of an imbalance okay now why the question is you know well And then before we actually move on, I'll move on to the why now. And then we also want to see volatility, okay. So if we've been trading in say, you know, five tick ranges or eight tick ranges, we want to see this impulse move. We want to see the range really expand there. We want to see, you know, the buyers really step in and get stuck in and get their work done.

It's simple. Your bigger timeframe participants don't stop out the same way in which the smaller timeframe participants do. In other words, on the break a whole bunch of longs got into the market.

I know some people on a daily candle you might call this a head fake or a It is the gold 30-minute chart and what we can see is our really key resistance here Okay, it's not key resistance because of that red line. It's key resistance cause of the snap in volume So we can see the volume. Okay, we can see the volatility note the low volume area and the initiative Okay, we then run into obviously some absorption. We get a shallow pullback. That's our shallow pullback before rotating higher Okay, so that's in essence our key breakout. Now note this color line shouldn't be red, it should be dark blue. Okay, for me I use dark blue, but obviously you can use whichever color you like. Now this is the 20th of November in the gold market, and what we're gonna pay attention to is obviously what happens on that breakdown. Now, one of the things I must mention, which is very typical within the strategy, and that's also why I said it can take some time, is When the market does come back in and fill that low volume area or the stops, what it does tend to do is begin the process of moving sideways.

So we can see obviously the first time we come up here there's a real aggressive amount of volume and a shift in the delta.

I was going to hopefully say if I could move this yellow thing because you'll see a little bit of imbalance, but in essence we've got a little bit of imbalance as the market comes back to retest that support before catapulting higher. Note the very light colors obviously. Then again, notice the shallow pullback. So shallow pullback and a great deal of absorption. This is one of the key identifiers again of the breakout. Okay, obviously then we get the low volume, so notice the imbalances, the imbalances, the very light volumes and extension, again, low volume, light colors and extension.

Yeah So the market came back below the the 93 93.1 and now it's come back to test that little resistance area Okay, so this is our resistance area. We could see the market comes into it to test it first time Okay, you test it a second time a third time and a fourth time so we can really see now how Initially we had the breakout, but now the key resistance is now acting as resistance Again, and that's really one of the key observations when taking this trade Okay So it gives you a real great deal of opportunity to get short terms of stop very simply above the top point there And again, as we said, in terms of our leveraging process, we'd be looking to leverage somewhere below that key swing point. So that's where we would add on to the strategy. That's kind of where we get the confirmation that the strategy now is in full play. Now, note. Obviously, what we're looking for in terms of target is we're looking for that, we're looking for the unwind of the delta. Note up until that point we can see how cumulatively the delta was positive all day and we can see also once we came below that price, notice how the delta was still positive. Okay, so the buyer is not giving up and this is a real key observation. The buyers won't give up until we take out one of the key swing points and that little dip lower when we re-enter the range. Okay, note obviously this didn't quite break down from", "transcript": "the very light volumes and extension, again, low volume, light colors and extension. Okay, and that's the process of the breakout, so we can see this market having broken from again somewhere around the 94s all the way up to the 97 and a halves. Okay, so that's our process of a breakout that's occurred. once or the most important point is once this area there's a low volume area and this low volume area begins the process of Filling out and we could see that you can see how suddenly the market begins the process of filling out these low volume Areas, okay, and this is the key note the sideways trade note the sideways trade, okay So that's effectively what brings this strategy into play. So we've seen the break We've observed the break of key resistance. We've observed the key facts that identify Key resistance or support in another example and we've now seen the market Fill out all the low-volume area and ultimately it brings our trade strategy in to play Okay, so let's look a lot now and see what happens once we get back below the key sort of area so note What I said as we can see the market comes down. Okay, this becomes in essence now Well, it's it's actually a little bit lower down. It's somewhere around this price. Yeah So the market came back below the the 93 93.1 and now it's come back to test that little resistance area Okay, so this is our resistance area.

Note obviously the very high volume that is a good signal of the stops. Also note obviously the imbalance as well as the stopouts. A couple of zeros there, a couple of zeros there before the market begins the process of balancing. Okay. So all we're looking for is guys, we're looking for the short there, we're looking for the leverage somewhere over there, and we're looking to take profit once we get that very aggressive delta unwind. Okay, that then is our static examples of the trade strategy. Let's go now and look at what a practical example would look like in the failed break of support and resistance. Okay, now what does this going to appear like as you can see on the chart in the Okay now obviously like I said in terms of imbalance and balance markets this is going to play slightly better in the imbalance markets. Why? Well simply put in the imbalance markets we obviously have the potential for breakout. Why? Because we're trading at extremes. Okay so at extremes by the very nature prices are about to shift into discovery mode therefore we're more likely to see obviously more aggressive breakouts. Now obviously What we want to pay attention to is what occurs once we take out that break So let's just fast forward this and see what happens Okay, so we come down to that low straight away and notice the bad low guys 140 trade of the low plus another 80 odd you know not a very good low at all and Let's see what happens once we take out this low. Okay, so we can see the first observation note the imbalance Okay, real good imbalance, real good bit of initiative taking place. This is a real key telltale sign, okay? That's what you want to see on a breakout. You really want to see imbalance. What you don't want to see, and this is the most important part, I'm just going to pause this here, what you don't want to see is that sort of response of buying why. high volume, delta as we can see, delta in the direction, high volume. But what we don't want to see is we don't want to see the market ultimately being responsive just below the break point. Okay that's very unusual, why? Because we said by definition a breakout, all time frame participants are now short. Okay so we've seen the initiative therefore all time frame participants should be short but someone is sitting there reloading and that's And this is what you're going to see now in a fail breaking support. This is a much quicker one than I showed you in the examples.", "transcript": "Okay, so the buyer is not giving up and this is a real key observation.

Obviously the slower ones, the ones that occur over a couple of hours, they can be a little bit easier, but the faster ones are just as effective. Okay, so what you've seen there, really big absorption, marker comes back to that original support. Okay, we notice the initiative we notice the high volume and the Delta. Okay highest volume of the day Also, the highest Delta negative of the day. Okay. Well, it's now come back into range now Like we said earlier, we're not looking to preempt. We're simply waiting for the retest of Ultimately the previous low. Okay. That's what we're gonna get you. Ultimately the market comes down trades 20 lots at oh twos comes down a second time trades 96 at oh threes and then simply just catapults in the opposite direction. So again, note what we can see and this is quite crucial. Okay, you can really see this what I'm saying to you. You're always going to get responsive sellers in the opposite direction and that's what the $188, $144, $159 is. That's effectively as the markets gone backward, you've still got participants that won't give up on those shorts but instead want to add to those shorts. Okay, and that's the key.

Obviously note that very very aggressive reloading from not just the sellers Just remember that is ultimately buyers buying at much higher prices. So again You know one thing you must learn also about the footprint is that for every seller being aggressive There's also potentially a buyer being aggressive. Okay, that's important concept to understand okay, so as we can see market spends a little bit of consolidation and ultimately the market eventually takes out where those key sellers were, leaves a little bit of a low-volume area again and again note the reloading.
