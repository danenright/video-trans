This is a bit of a scalp type strategy we're looking for a logical target something like maybe a fill of the imbalance or Something a little bit smaller. So just try and find something that's a bit of an obvious type target But again always keep in the back of your mind and that elephants likely left a bad low And is likely get a revisited. So just factor that in to the equation In terms of risk-reward, obviously because we're managing the risk quite tight stop we have got relatively good reward metrics. Okay application we're going to be very exact here in process we can't really afford to gamble over prices why if we're risking say three prices to make 10 to 15 prices okay there's not a great deal of wiggle room there in which we can't be exact so it's a very exact application in terms of execution no need to preempt. In terms of leverage, we don't leverage on this, we don't even consider leveraging, we simply just take the increment out of the market. Now, in terms of a scalp, I always like to think of a scalp as nicking ticks. Okay, that's why a lot of our traders scalp the markets. Obviously, we like the big moves, we like to get on the big moves, the big breakouts, et cetera. But when the markets present you with a scalp opportunity with a high probability, we're going to nick those ticks effectively and so should you. Okay, in terms of the tip for this strategy, learn what is large absorption. in the market. We spoke about this quite extensively in the strategy. If you know what large absorption is, you'll know when there's elephant in the market and you'll be able to take advantage and nick some ticks. Now again, another one of my favourite books, The Obstacle is the Way, I think the title gives it away. What this book goes about is finding numerous obstacles and showing how within every single one of these obstacles, i.e. failures, i.e. difficult moments, there is always a way forward. Okay, and it's that understanding, that principle understanding that this book is all about. Now, note Ryan Holliday as the author. He's written a number of books, one of them which is very popular and we will is the ego is the enemy so in terms of a summary you know this book ultimately transforms obstacles into opportunity so it's just a mindset shift in essence okay it shows you how most people think of obstacles as bad things they think them as you know how am I going to get through this etc etc but Ryan Holiday tries to dispel that and make you realize that every time there is an obstacle through a little bit of a mindset shift", "transcript": "All right, then obviously with regards to execution methodology for the hiding down the elephant strategy Firstly, obviously our entry point is is passive in nature We don't want to be aggressive simply because we're going for a relatively small winner Obviously then do note our stop placement slightly behind the elephant with the base of the reversal Our target like said a little bit smaller.

In terms of action, again, this is very thought provoking and it's going to want you to adjust the way you think about obstacles in general. Again, another process like we saw in Ray Dalio, obviously a step-for-step process to identify the opportunity in an obstacle. This is key because sometimes we can't always see the potential opportunity until much later on. Nice step-for-step process. Note, obviously, it's going to show you how to manage difficult situations through a process of marginalizing. Breaking down obstacles into very small margins, into very small segments is ultimately Then shift your mindset to accepting obstacles and aligning focus and energy accordingly. So in other words, rather than getting your back up with the obstacle, rather focus your energy on getting through it and getting beyond it. Then obviously the journey through a tough situation is ultimately what real growth is about. So he goes on then to focus on how every time we do have an obstacle, ultimately Okay, and then obviously all about failures again. We saw this in Ray Dalio. We can see this in most of the books which is the principle of learning from your failures, learning the lessons from your failures. You're gonna see me talk about this through numerous strategies. Most of the strategies I've learned throughout my career have come from initial failures. Alright, that is then obviously the second book I would recommend for additional reading. Okay, we've come then to the end of unit 7. This is the end of obviously strategy 2. What I'm going to say is, obviously, again, you've been through this how to complete the drill process, note, watch the drill in its entirety, again, complete the template by yourself. Once you've completed that template, then go and watch the guided tuition. That's just to ensure that you are gaining and growing in your own way with completing the template. Do note, obviously, you can see some stars there. What that's showing us is that the practical example, the drill example, will be the So you're going to go over the same example this time on your own and obviously note once you have completed your own template, compare notes to the guided tuition, make adjustments accordingly and again once you have confidence in your understanding and you're ready to Do bear in mind that at the end of every one of these units, you have got a day off.
