In the three examples I'm going to show you, however, we are only going to be dealing Now, that is our first consolidation breakout. The second consolidation breakout is traditionally known as the inside daybreak. So this is where day two sits well within day one and then day three we get the breakout to the upside or to the downside. Now, note again, it's important when you have this inside day trade that you stick with the short term trend. So in theory, the short term trend, you know, day two break or day three inside day breakout will be more powerful than if it breaks against, you know, the short term trend. The third of the consolidation breakouts, I will show you, is where we have the market that is almost ranging or moving or consolidating ahead of maybe a key long-term resistance point or maybe a key long-term trend line. That's the third type of consolidation breakout play that you can find. on any breakout of a consolidation phase are the same. First and foremost, we want initiative. That is key. We've spoken about initiative a number of times, not just in module one and two, but also in the momentum series. So we want to see initiative taken, as you can see in this example, once we take out the key consolidation area. Number two, we want to see volume pick up. we want to see a very large surge in the volatility. So again remember volume and volatility are both relative terms. And then we want to see the very strong control identifiers such as low volume areas. Now, in the example provided, let's have a look at, you know, one, the preconditions of this consolidation breakout, as well as how we would execute, where we would enter, and our likely targets. Now, as you can see from the chart, we are looking for a break. We've obviously had day one, day two is inside day one, day three is inside day two, so we can see the range is constricting and the market is preparing itself for Now, again, like I said to you, this market could go either way.

It could break to the upside, it could break down to the downside. Obviously, if the short-term trend is to the downside, it will likely be more powerful if it breaks the downside, but that does not mean we preempt. Please trust me on this. If you don't trust me, go and do the back test. pre-empting does not give you the additional amount of reward that you are taking on in the event that it does fail. So you can take this trade on three or four or five times and you're likely going to get stopped out and all those losses you would have taken will never justify any kind Remember, guys, it's all about timing when it comes to developing your strategies and developing the highest probability outcomes that will make you profitable at the end of the day. So the key is we wait for the break. By waiting for the break, we can manage the most important thing, which is risk. In other words, by the definition, a momentum play has got minimum risk and maximum upside. Now what we want to talk about is we are entering once we see that initiative. So we can see the market showing some very early initiative. It then takes out, in this example of the oil, it takes out the previous day's low before distributing quite aggressively as we see the initiative break. Now the important thing to look at in terms of this is once we see that initiative, above the point where the initiative is taken. In terms of target, remember what I said to you, we have maximum upside. Now, in this, when you have these consolidation breaks, there's a general rule of thumb. The bigger the consolidation area and the longer it's taken its time to form. In other words, a consolidation area of three days versus one of, say, six months. In the example of three days, you want to be looking for a smaller target than in the example of a six months. The reason is simple. When a market has waited this long for a long term break, we're likely to see much larger influential participants enter the market, which will almost exacerbate the Now as you can see in this example, after four days we initially got nice aggressive short side opportunity and the market continued to move lower.

So long as the market keeps showing initiative as it's moving in our favor, we do not want to get out. If, for example, in this instance the market came back and started to fill out these areas, we can then look to take some profit and exit this trade, locking in some profit. So again, when you have these initiative moves on the consolidation breakout, we exit not when we feel comfortable, not when the profit is enough, but we exit when some other time frame participants respond to the prices being advertised.

So the second in our example is the again, well this is obviously the breakdown of the oil again, and just note the initiative. Notice how we saw the initiative and the market came back and gave us almost a picture perfect entry. Now what I will say again as a rule of thumb, remember, and this is something will always reward he who is patient, patient enough to not get over anxious. Now what I mean by that is, what you typically find on these big consolidation breakouts Because everyone is seeing the same thing, because participants have had a long time to sort of develop an idea as to how they're going to execute this opportunity, we tend to find people who miss the early move get involved and short in some very bad areas, almost an anxious type entry. And it's this anxiety that ultimately allows the market to come back and give us the What I will say, in my experience as a trader, is that more often than not, the market will always give you that one opportunity. But the question is, if you have been overanxious and you've, you know, sort of been muddled in your approach and your strategy, you probably won't be able to take advantage So be patient on entry, and once you do enter, don't give up that position without a very strong fight. Take the risk on the strategy because remember, we've got minimum risk and we've got maximum upside. Okay, so let's move to another example. This is our second of our consolidation day types.
