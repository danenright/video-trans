So effectively what we're doing is sometimes these are a little bit more sophisticated than the simple vanilla iceberg is as we've mentioned earlier on and I wanted you to look into defining what a time and volume slice order on those links that I gave earlier in the slides and really important to understand that the volume slice order can occur over potentially 100,000 contracts and only gets executed every time a thousand contracts go into the market. So it's your ability to now start looking at a more macro time frame or macro volume range and sometimes when you observe an absorption pattern it can occur over multiple hours whether it's time or volume slice order and it's your ability to see that that the market is really failing to advance towards the downside if there's a buy side time slice or volume slice order. And sometimes you can actually use on the various different platforms or what they call the aggressive buyers versus sellers or aggressive sellers versus buyers. They call it the delta of the markets. And really important that this is more information gathering into the next day's trading opportunity where a market is fixed in a zone for long period of time and then the next day when the market escapes that zone you get a momentum move as the congestion disappears. Time and volume slice orders are more a contextual understanding. And they can operate. You can get a volume slice order of, say, 50,000 contracts and that can occur over a 20 minute period. And therefore that's a lot easier to see. But it's a little bit more difficult to see if it's over a larger time frame. And that's where your larger time frame contextual understanding is important. And that really develops as you gain more experience in this game. So as I've mentioned, these patterns can occur throughout a training session and are harder to decipher from a micro time frame perspective entire price or time range you know the time slice order can say you know buy me a hundred thousand contracts every two hours every two hours and they use an iceberg to buy those so it's becoming more of a sophisticated type of algorithm when it's executing those types of orders these execution strategies behind these patterns usually curve over a couple of hours and and therefore using the delta of the market as the main signal. So for example the market has sold off passively all day and it's sold off but the delta of the market is meaning that is negative 120 000 contracts so effectively there's been", "transcript": "Okay, so order book absorption event three and it's observing time and volume slice order distribution information gathering patterns.
