A few things I want you to watch for whilst watching this auction is, obviously we have a seller who wants to sell the car. But more importantly the seller wants to hit the reserve price. Now you're going to see during the auction he does get advice about lowering his reserve price and he actually sticks to his guns and follows through on the auction. So watch very carefully, note also we have two major bidders in this process. Look at, for instance, the momentum throughout the auction, the speeds of the bid. In other words, in the beginning, you'll see they're quite aggressive bids, and then you'll see it start to slow up. Have a think about where discount price is. Have a think about price skipping. Have a think about how the bid stalls, and where the market or where the auction tends to find fair value. Have a think about the concept of excess, in other words, when have we moved very aggressively away from value and what does that mean in terms of the auction. Also have a look at the change in price, so the increments in which the auctioneer moves the price. Have a watch of this auction and I hope you enjoy.", "transcript": "We're now going to watch a very fascinating auction that took place in the United States.
