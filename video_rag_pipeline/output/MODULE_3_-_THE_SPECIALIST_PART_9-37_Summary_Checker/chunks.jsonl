Just remember, the reason I have these questions here is to ensure you've understood a lot of the principles we've dealt with in part 9. So I'll answer the following questions. What is the difference between a composite profile and a regular volume profile? And why do we use composite profiles? What is the high-volume area and low-volume area, and what are the basic principles that govern these two concepts? And then lastly, define the anomaly strategies in terms of time frame players, initiative versus responsive, time objective, volume and volatility, risk and reward. Good luck!", "transcript": "Welcome to part 9, Summary Checker.
