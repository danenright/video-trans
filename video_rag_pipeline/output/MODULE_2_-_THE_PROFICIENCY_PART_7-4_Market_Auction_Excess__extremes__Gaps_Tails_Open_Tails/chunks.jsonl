An example I sometimes use with the younger guys to illustrate this concept of excess is a baker. So let's say for instance a baker bakes a thousand loaves at say $50. Now the cost of, the price being advertised for these loaves is crucially important as to how many people are going to physically buy his loaves. Okay, you'll straight away, or sorry, yeah, to $55, you will see that we still have, you know, someone or a thousand demanding, you know, those loads at $55. So again... markets are accepting price or buyers and sellers are happy to engage at this price. However once we move the price up to 60, notice how the demand for their initial 1000 loaves suddenly drops to 800. So straight away we can see that as price moves higher we're not getting quite the same demand as we had when prices were lower. So what happens then? The market quickly moves back towards fair price. So just a very basic illustration of what happens when the market moves from fair value, moves toward excess and then very quickly moves back towards fair value. Now note three forms of excess we find the first is a gap So a price gap is where the market opens substantially high or low from the closing price these gaps can be created for a fundamental or a technical reason and Note technical gaps are far more likely to be filled than fundamental gaps and the basic premise is very simple When a market technically gaps, or when a market gaps as a result of say overnight moves or maybe aggressive sort of price response from the previous day, or an aggressive open strategy, well a lot of the time these gaps will be filled as there's very little fundamentals underlying the move.", "transcript": "We spoke a little bit in part six about excess and and you know how the market forms tops and bottoms and we're now going to revisit that idea and just talk a little bit further about excess just get a little bit more understanding behind you know how and why the market forms you know excess tops and bottoms so very briefly market excess you know when the market in order for it to find discount and premium prices sometimes the market needs to Sometimes price will go a long, long way and it won't make sense, but the only reason that auctions at these points is because, remember, the objective of the market is to facilitate trade between longer-term buyers and sellers, so that is why sometimes prices need to go very, very high to find where are those sellers and very, very low to find where are those buyers.

Now the good example to use is, obviously recently this year when we had the Brexit, if you go look, the gap in the sterling versus dollar up at 151, somewhere there, may take a couple of years for the market to fill out. However that gap remains and it will remain until such a point that the fundamentals either change or there's a good reason for the markets to revisit that point. The second form of access is tails, now we get two types of tails, the first is the invisible tail. Now it's a relatively simple but very important sort of market access to consider. When we have a normal tail you would be able to identify quite easily on a volume profile because it sticks out. Now an invisible tail doesn't quite stick out that easily, but all an invisible tail is, is it's a very aggressive auction within the day's range. It's where market very quickly initiates from one point to another and continues to initiate. An invisible tail is nothing more than an initiative move taken by the buyers or sellers but within the already established range of the day. And I will show you an example of this in the next slide, so do not worry too much if you don't understand the invisible tail. Then obviously the open tail or what we like to think of as the high or the low or the extreme tail, an example we saw back in part 6. Now the open tail is the tail left within the first hour of trade, so the initial as it shows us early confidence in the market to move toward the upside or to the downside.
