What is edge? Edge can be a number of things. For me, edge is very simple. It's an advantage. It's a unique advantage. Now the important thing to understand about edge, guys, is that edge doesn't last forever, okay? The reason it doesn't last forever is because as time goes by More and more people that are observing loads of different strategies will eventually pick up on your unique edge. So how do you keep this edge? Well, it's very simple. You have to continue to develop this edge, and you have to continue to develop other edges. By doing this, you will ensure that you always have a unique advantage over the market. So, how do we effectively develop our own edge? For me, there's three basic things you need to do. 1. You need to continuously recognise patterns. We can do this utilizing volume profiling. By constantly looking at the markets through a volume profile, we'll be able to not only just look at our own edges or strategies, but we'll be able to develop unique new strategies. Every time you have a strategy, you need to go away and keep going over and over that strategy. Keep practicing that strategy in your head, on paper, in the markets. You need to constantly be upgrading that strategy and developing various skills around that strategy to ensure that you always master that strategy as well as you can. Remember guys, in this day and age with the advent of algorithms, every tick counts. Every increment counts. so you have to be perfect. If you're less than perfect, you're leaving money on the table. Last, manage and perfect the process. This is what caps off edge. If you can have a perfect process, in whatever you're executing, whatever strategy, it doesn't matter. If you can perfect that process, you will be successful, you will have a long lasting edge. Trading is all about controlling the controllables. You cannot control the market, you cannot dictate which way the market goes, but you can control your own process. You do this and you will have a unique advantage.", "transcript": "The definition of edge. What is edge? Edge can be a number of things. For me, edge is very simple. It's an advantage.
