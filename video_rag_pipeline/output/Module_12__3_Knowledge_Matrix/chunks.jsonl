So we're looking at, once a market has broken, left a really thin area of hardly any traded activity, and then you start seeing the auctioning activity going on the price ladder, and how you position yourself in that play, and we'll be looking at it in a video later on in this module. Then we look at the classic volume slam dunk play. The volume slam dunk is how you're gonna get away, and how you're gonna be so aggressive to getting away as much size as possible. You see that complete shift in momentum before a critical breakout point, that critical juncture where you are seeing the price ladder, seeing the auction activity, seeing the speed on the ladder, seeing the exchange and the activity that the probability is in your favour to start accelerating your size towards that breakout level as a probability of the break towards the upside or the downside is really in your favour and you have to optimise strategy on executing it. And then we look at a stop hunter predominantly in very illiquid markets or volatile markets where you're locating a critical juncture point in that market where there could be a flurry of stops where people have to exit positions so you want to trade in favor of those stops so you're looking for those critical juncture points where you're going to really optimize your. trade and then really for each of those plays we're going to be looking, focusing like we said and this entire structure of how we're really focusing our entire framework and methodology on how we learn, how we compartmentalize the different elements of our price data strategy whether it be large orders, absorption, spoofing and flipping, reversal and momentum plays.

Is it a volatile environment? Is it a thin, illiquid environment? Is the auction activity high or low? Is the speed of the trades that are going through the market high or low?
