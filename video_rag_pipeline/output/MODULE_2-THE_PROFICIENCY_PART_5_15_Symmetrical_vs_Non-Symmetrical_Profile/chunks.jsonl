We're going to start talking a little bit about symmetry now, so symmetrical and non-symmetrical profiles. Again, whilst we go through, particularly module 2, we're going to talk a lot about structure and how profiles develop and the shape of the profiles. Now, it's this shape and this structure that is going to help us develop context and understanding, but later on develop our strategies based on the context and understanding. crucial guys, we don't just do volume profiling to develop strategies. We utilize it because it gives us an objective understanding and approach to executing within the markets. so they represent equal opportunities on both long and short positions, for example a normal distribution. Now what I mean by that is when a market is normally distributing, the opportunities in terms of strategies are more or less equal whether you're buying it or whether you're selling it and you'll understand what I mean by this as we go Then, the market is in balance, awaiting further information before making a directional move. So this is the reason why there's an equal opportunity, because the market is accepting fair value, buyers and sellers are agreeing to a price, and by that token, neither buyers want to buy premium, nor do the sellers want to sell discount prices. Then, the opposite of that is non-symmetrical profiles or not balanced. Now, as you can see in the pictures, our first blue little picture there, that's what a typical normal distribution looks like. What you'll notice is that the majority of the trade is executed within 70 to 90% of the mean, in other words, the average price on the day. Now non-symmetrical profiles, as you can see by the pictures, have somewhat of a skew. It could be a positive skew or a negative skew. Now non-symmetrical profiles by that very definition mean non-equal opportunities. Now it's important you understand the idea of non-symmetry because it's non-symmetry that starts to give us a little bit of a lean, not necessarily a bias, but a little In other words, imagine I said to you you walked into a casino and I said to you there's roughly a 60% chance that we could land on the color red on the roulette table. I think most of you would agree you would look to take that opportunity as you have an edge. It's similar in this sense. When there is non-symmetry in a market it gives us a little bit of a lean in one direction or the other and that's why this principle is crucial to understand.", "transcript": "So it's time to bring those statistics textbooks out.
