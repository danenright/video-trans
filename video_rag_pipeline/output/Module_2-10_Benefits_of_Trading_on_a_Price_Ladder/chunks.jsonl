Now those of you who are used to just executing with one level of data where you just see how you can execute on the buy or the sell side or waiting to deal a ticket or have an order ticket on your traditional spread betting platforms, an exercise that I want a market ladder and I want you to put one lot on the price ladder and use that exact same size that you would be using on a spread betting platform or whatever. Pick whatever spread betting platform you want to use and whether that spread betting platform is a current one that you use at the moment I want you ready to see that when you enter at market because the price ladder is connected to directly with the exchanges and you have direct market access You have to work out the mathematics of effectively every single time you go in a market and you get the best price, whereas opposed to when there's a spread on the on any of these spread betting platforms, if you now count that over a week, over a month over a year, over two years, and you multiply that spread out every single day, especially if you trade more than, you know, more than once, twice a day.
