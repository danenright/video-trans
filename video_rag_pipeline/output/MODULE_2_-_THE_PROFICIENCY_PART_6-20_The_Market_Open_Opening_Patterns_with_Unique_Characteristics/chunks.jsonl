Now again, it's a slightly less convicted open than the test drive and the open test drive. we for instance in the graphic depiction the first one you can see we open mark marker tries to move you know sort of higher and then it runs into very aggressive uh... you know sellers that initiate aggressive shorts now uh... once it runs into these aggressive other side time frame players they then very quickly take advantage of those prices and reject and reverse uh... you know the initial movement Note, when we do see an open rejection reversal, there is a lower probability of a trend day and a higher probability of a symmetrical balanced day type. So again, this is why we discuss the various open types, because they give us early identification as to how the day may play out, but also what sort of strategies we'd be able to employ over the day. Again what I just want to point out, if you look at the volume profile, you'll see the market sort of tries to drift and move lower. It then runs into some not just responsive buying but a very aggressive initiative buying and the market very quickly rejects and reverses in the opposite direction. However, we do then for the rest of the day begin to balance out and what we can see here is just a traditional sort of P-shaped type profile which is also known as a short covering type day. Note again, confidence in the reversal is seen by a lack of overlap in the TPO, so again what we mean by that is if you can see the K and the L prints, they move lower and the M print almost takes out the entire initial range and that's the reversal that is seen at this open. When we do see that, we do want to look for a continuation of that reversal initially Note, again, the trade works once we're above the open, so once we start to print above that opening price, that is when it becomes suggestive of a potential for an open rejection reverse. And note, there's a high probability once we take up that open to continue auctioning higher. TPO tail, so as you can see in the volume profile we have the tail there, as well as obviously where we close on the previous day, or where the market is trading in terms of trade location.
