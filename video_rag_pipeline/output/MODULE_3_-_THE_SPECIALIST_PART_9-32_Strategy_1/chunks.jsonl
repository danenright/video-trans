Is it from a balanced perspective with regards to the previous day or out of balance? All these sort of, you know, definitions we spoke about throughout Module 1 and 2, of the trade location.

Now, by level of conviction, again, this is more about what is the likelihood that this will hold or the initiative will hold. Some of the things we want to interpret there is in terms of location, are we inside the previous day's range or not? Are we balancing or not? Are we outside of the previous day or is there even positioning in the market? Don't forget, a lot of the time these single prints could be created because there is positioning the wrong way around. The next characteristic we will discuss is volume and volatility. So the important thing to understand with regards to this is we need to see a pickup in the volume as well as obviously the volatility. Now we've spoken in depth about volatility being nothing more than sort of an expansion of the TPO or a much wider TPO relative to the rest of the day and we can see that in this basic example how the market was sort of moving relatively sideways before we then got a bit of range expansion in the P and S prints. Now, again, another important aspect is that what we ideally want to see characteristically is we want to see the TPO or the range being extended by at least a hundred percent. In other words, what we've created in terms of a range from 51.60 up to 52.10, we want to see at least 50 ticks to the downside, and again, this is more because this ensures that we are actually seeing initiative instead of just maybe a short-term burst towards the downside. Then, it's key to interpret also the, you know, what are we running away from? Where are these single prints being initiative, you know, initiative being taken from? Now, what we mean by that is a market that, for instance, is trading, you know, or been trading for some time in a tight range that then breaks lower versus a market that maybe has a much smaller distribution before breaking lower. more accepted or pronounced accepted area has a higher probability of maybe selling off but then also filling in for the rest of the session versus the second example where we have a smaller accepted area.

Then, it's important to understand the rules and preconditions that we would like to see before taking this play. Now, I'm going to go through them very briefly on the chart, but first and foremost, we want to see single prints or a low volume area. We want to see volatility plus volume. Thirdly, at least 100% expansion. So these are three vital conditions. We can see in this example, we can see the single prints and with the low volume area, we can see a pickup in the volatility as explained. with the sudden shift in the R and S print, and we can also see a 100% range extension as explained earlier. So straight away the preconditions are there, all the rules are there for us to take on this trade. When you see this sort of play, you don't want to fade, so you do not want to be sitting at this point looking to try and buy this market somewhere up. That is not the trade. We will go through the strategy or the actual execution in a minute. What is important in terms of rules is when we do enter on a pullback, we want Then in terms of the money management, well it's very simple. What we're trying to effectively do is we're trying to enter in terms of trade location where we can manage the most effective risk. So in terms of the chart, if we're entering down for fresh shorts after a relatively, or after an almost 100% extension, we're putting ourselves in a relatively weak position for shorts. So it's very important that you understand in terms of the management, we're looking single prints but after a decent pullback. In terms of the risk, once we've entered and the market has turned back towards the downside, as we can see in this example, we then place our stop above the point where the market pulled back and responsive sellers re-entered. Lastly, in terms of clip management, it's okay if you do enter a little bit early and go a little bit further off sides. That's not an issue. Remember, the first time you take this trade, there is still that little bit of initiative in the market. It's okay to have a wider stop because, in essence, we're looking for a target back attribution. So that would be our target.

So note, we can see we have sufficient risk or sufficient reward to give ourselves a relatively decent stop. Now moving on in terms of the execution and how you take the strategy once the preconditions and rules have been met It's very simple. We are looking for the first pullback So the first time after this market showing the initiative we are looking to enter on the first pullback now It's very important to understand on the first pullback. You have to be aggressive, okay? So the first time we come back and find those you know responsive sellers Then you need to be aggressively looking for shorts, targeting the lower end of the distribution. That is trade strategy number one. more passive on entry, so we don't want to be as aggressive, we still want to be short so long as the initiative holds, we enter a second time passively, again our stop goes above and again we're looking for just a rotational type play in the second attempt. So that is how we would execute a low volume error. given all of our characteristics have been met so long as the low volume area or the initiative area remains. Now, just in terms of some of the expectation analysis and emotions, I won't spend too much time on this as emotional analysis is very important, but I will give you a little bit of example of something that I would spend time with. Now, in terms of the emotional analysis, for me, by understanding that if I enter too short in this example, maybe somewhere around here, I do have the potential to maybe head offside or maybe the market goes slightly against me, but by interpreting very early on, this will enable me to sit in the trade even when I do go offside because I've emotionally understood what the potential is in terms of my risk. So make sure that when you do talk about emotional analysis, make it personal, make it so that it makes sense to you, but also that you understand from an emotional aspect what you might experience in the trade strategy. Then, in terms of some of the key expectation, time is a very important expectation in this because once we enter on that first pullback, we expect the market to relatively easily auction low. Why? We then get a first pullback and we should see some responsive sellers step in pretty aggressively and move the market lower.", "transcript": "That's not an issue.

So by definition, if we expect a strong response of selling on the first pullback by the token of time, it shouldn't take that long. So allocate a number of time. In this instance, I would say a maximum of three TPO's in order to complete the If it takes more than three GPOs, then we exit, okay, because the expectation has not been met.
