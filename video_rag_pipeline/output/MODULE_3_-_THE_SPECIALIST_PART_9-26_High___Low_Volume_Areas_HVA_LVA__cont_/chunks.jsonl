Firstly, though, however, it's important to understand why we utilise high and low-volume areas to develop trade strategies. The basic premise is that markets have got memory, and that is why low-volume areas and high-volume areas work well. These types of strategies are not easy to automate, and by that definition, they can be very profitable strategies for us because there are less algorithms interfering. Now, the important characteristics to understand with regards to high and low volume are as follows. Firstly, when it comes to low volume areas, your execution needs to be precise. The area of execution is very exact. Right in front of that low volume area where we've seen the initiative we expect to see some responsive players entering the market in the direction of the initiative or the short term trend. In comparison, a high volume area, we expect to see a lot of two-way trade being facilitated between buyers and sellers, and as such, the area in which you need to execute is far bigger, and you need to be far less aggressive and more passive on entry. Then, note, the low volume area, you want to trade with the short-term trend. Where there's a high volume area, you want to either trade with or against the With regards to stopping out, we stop out very easily with a low-volume area once the single prints begin to be traded, or once the initiative shows clear signs that it is disappearing. And in terms of high-volume areas, we exit once beyond the parameters of the brackets of the high-volume area, so again note the risk is far different in the low-volume In terms of the low volume area then, markets have memory for low volume areas and can trade low volume areas over days, weeks and months. So they can leave these low volume areas for a very long, long time, constantly showing this initiative. So, you know, you don't want to, just because you've taken the trade once with a short term trend, you know, it doesn't mean you can't take it a second, a third and a fourth time, okay? The market can leave these low volume areas for a very long, long time. and not take it a second and a third time. Then in terms of high-volume areas, markets have got short memory for high-volume areas and can trade high-volume areas over days, only a few days.
