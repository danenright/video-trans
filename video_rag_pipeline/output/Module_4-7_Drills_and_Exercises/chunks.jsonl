So what I want you to do, and I'll explain a little bit in the end why this drill is so important and what we're really trying to achieve from this drill, but I want you to take two sessions a key hours of focus. So for example, if you're trading in Europe and you're trading between the hours of 7 till 10 a.m. So the European cash, let's say in the UK time, so you're trading from 7 until 10 a.m. Pure focus, incredible stamina by just watching the ladder of one particular core market. And so you do one in the morning for three hours and then one in the afternoon for an entire week. And actually If you really want to become, and you're very serious about becoming a price ladder trader, which I hope all of those who are participating in the course, it's the main reason why you're participating in the course is to become an extremely successful order flow trader, and now what I want you to do is, after each session, Sketch out the chart of the market so without looking at the chart I want you to effectively and this is developing your price memory recall skills because the moment you have great price memory recall skill You're able to actually put the contextual patterns all together and just a brief little Simplistic example is for example a market approaches price approaches a certain level four times each day in a week so it approaches 50 one day approaches fifth at the same price 50 and every time it approaches approaches that level it gets sold back down into so it approaches it on monday tuesday wednesday and thursday and then by the time friday comes when it approaches 50 the order flow the way the the market starts interacting completely changes and just by that subtle shift because you've remembered how the market trades every single time because you've built that pattern skill in your head, you'll know this time the market is ripe for potential break and you're able to really exploit your size and put on a lot more aggressive size into the market.

And as I've mentioned then add a third layer dimension by recalling price ladder volume events So if you plot for those three hours the market is just oscillating in a certain range Then all of a sudden you observe that the market becomes really active at a price And then you get this really strong powerful 30 tick move in a two-minute time period I want you to be able to recall where you observed the shift In initiative activity which will which this might become this might be difficult for you to cross now Until you've done all the all the other modules But as you do all the other modules, I want you to be doing this exercise, you know And I've mentioned there do it for a week I want you to do it for the rest of your career if you are really serious by developing your pattern recognition Skills and and ready this builds your you know, as I've mentioned this builds your unconscious pattern recognition inventory.
