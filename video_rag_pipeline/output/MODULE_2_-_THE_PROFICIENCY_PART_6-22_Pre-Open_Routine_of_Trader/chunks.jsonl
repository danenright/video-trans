Now, in the next slide we are going to talk a little bit more about trade location, but merely trade location is where we are trading relative to sort You then want to think about the overnight dynamics, in other words, what have your key markets like, if you're trading the European session, what has the Japanese yen done or what has the gold bullion done or what have the U.S. bond markets done, the Asian bourses done and the dollar?

Again we need to interpret you know where it's opening relative to where it should open as this will throw up Then we need to have a look at, once the market opens, how much conviction is there by watching the open play. So remember we spoke about the four open plays being the open drive, the open test drive, the open rejection reversal and the auction open. Now depending on which open it is, we can develop a level of conviction as well Then, where does the open play occur? Is it in value? Is it in and out of range?
