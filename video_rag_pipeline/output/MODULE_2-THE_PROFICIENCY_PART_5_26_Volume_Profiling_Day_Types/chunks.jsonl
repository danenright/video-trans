So the neutral day is where a buyer and a seller agree on fair value quite easily and quite often. Now both timeframes are very active within this day type and they tend to initiate until they run into responsive and then they tend to reverse and the market Initial balance range for the neutral day will be between a normal day, so very, very wide, and between a trend day, which can be small or medium. So the initial balance size of a neutral day can be relatively average. As you can see in the example, the market trades on both sides of the initial balance. So whilst we had in the first example, we had the market trading the entire session both sides of the initial balance. More importantly, it tends to reject both sides of the initial This rejection, or once we re-enter the initial balance, this gives us sort of an early identifier that we are likely to take up the other side of the initial balance. So a very important strategy that a lot of traders look for is once we've taken out one side of the initial balance and shown some sort of reversal type indications, we then look to target the other side of the initial balance being broken. Again, this is another important non-trending type day type. Note, we do extend the initial balance on both sides. We then have two types of closes and this is important to pay attention. We have a neutral close. Now a neutral close is where the close of the market occurs within value area. So a pretty ordinary close where neither buyer nor seller kind of victoriously wins However, when we get a neutral extreme close, this is where the market shuts at either the high or the low. When we do have one of these extreme closes, this is giving us quite an early signal for the next day's trade. Why? As you can see in the two examples provided, the first one we have a relatively neutral close where the market traded both sides of the initial balance. The second example is where we traded both sides of the initial balance but we had an extreme close. In an extreme close situation, we would be looking for early buy side opportunities in the next day. We will discuss these sorts of strategies as we move along further.", "transcript": "The neutral day.
