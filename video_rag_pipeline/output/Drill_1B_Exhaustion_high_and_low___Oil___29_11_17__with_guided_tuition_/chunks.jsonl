This is the Exhaustion high and low strategy. Now what I really like about this example, I kind of hope that a lot of you are left there maybe scratching your head feeling or you were a little bit uncertain as to how the strategy worked because that was the intention guys. You know, one of the most important things when you go through this process of developing your strategies is that I've outlined very clear approaches to every one of these strategies. Now, it's so crucial that you follow that approach, okay, because that's what is underlying the strategy, that's what's giving the consistency to the strategy. It's the methodology that's ultimately not just been adopted but that's being followed. So make sure you follow the process of each strategy when we go through them. Exhaustion high and low, the first most important thing is the pre-context. We need to identify a market that is entering a phase where we might see some form of an exhaustion high or low. An exhaustion high or low simply means the market needs to take some form Now we identified two key real signals that can show us that the market has formed one of these exhaustion highs and lows and that comes down to either some zeros at the low or an imbalance at the low. Those are the two key identifiers that we could visually see for an auction high or low to have formed. What's wonderful about this example is that you're going to see neither, you're not going to see zeros at the low, you're not going to see a stop run with the zeros, and you're not going to see an imbalance either at the low. What you're going to see is a low being formed on a great deal of absorption. That's what we're seeing on this example. We can see the market's extended itself on the candlestick chart. We've done a good move from 88s down to 30s. has entered a point of oversold conditions, we can see the high volume as well as the Delta, all showing us that this market is potentially reaching an exhausted point. What the marker doesn't show us, what the footprint doesn't show us, is that real clue, that real signal that actually this is an exhaustion high or low. It simply just runs into a pocket position. We can see a great deal of pocket positioning, a high volume, a lot of absorption took place And ultimately, once that fill was done, we then started to see the market rotate higher. So straight away again, I hope a lot of you did this drill, you went through it, maybe you even watched it a second time, trying to find those zeros, trying to find that imbalance, couldn't find it, and you were left a bit confused because that then means", "transcript": "Welcome then to strategy 5.
