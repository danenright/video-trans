Outside of the cash areas it's not to say that there isn't buyers and sellers, however the type of participants is very different to what you'll see when we have the cash hours.

Okay and then obviously do note I am going to share with you quite a few rules of thumb but bear in mind they are generalizations.

As you're going through the strategies, what you can do is you can come back to this unit and view the different principles that are adopted within key elements of the strategies that we're going to focus on. Okay guys, so that being said, let's get straight into it then. Now, first thing is that the first principle we want to talk about is a strong and weak auction process. Okay, so very simply, an auction process is where buyers and sellers are interacting with one another. Buyers will obviously in theory interact when prices are at a discount price, and Now, anything in between, markets in theory are fairly balanced. So anywhere within this we are reaching a fair price or a balanced market. Now, obviously the basic assumption is markets will very quickly move away from discount and equally very quickly navigate away from premium prices. OK, bear in mind obviously the basic premise of the market or the markets were created in order to facilitate trade. So between where discount prices and buyers will be and between buyers or sellers at premium prices the market will oscillate and facilitate the trade. that we look at in terms of rotations and processes is this interaction. It's all about interaction. That's what the footprint is all about. So what we're going to learn about, and I will talk a lot about this quite extensively in a couple of slides time, is this concept of initiative and responsive.

It's all about interaction. That's what the footprint is all about. So what we're going to learn about, and I will talk a lot about this quite extensively in a couple of slides time, is this concept of initiative and responsive. So very simply, initiative is simply where a buyer or a seller steps into the market, initiates trade in a one directional manner, in an aggressive type of manner. Now that's initiative. What then happens is, as markets initiate in an auction, they then bring in responsive type participants. In other words, to say a fairer value, we will then see a responsive action taken by a participant that deems this as fair value. So they're responding to the higher price or responding to the auction of higher prices. So it's simply that interaction, this navigation between initiative and responsive, that's what we're going to talk about quite extensively over the next couple of slides. One of the things we do look at when we talk about the auction process is the type of overlap. This is quite crucial. Overlap simply means, if I show you on the chart, on the left side we can see almost a full overlap, a 100% overlap between rotations, whereas in the latter part of the chart we can see a lot less overlap. Now stronger auctions tend to have less rotational overlap, whereas weaker auctions Okay, then obviously in terms of strong and weak auctions, very strong auctions tend to show something called one-time framing. Now again in the example what we'll see is where we have rotations that cannot take out the previous low of a rotation. That is what we call one-time framing. Now a very strong auction process will show this and exhibit this type of one-time okay then in terms of the another one of the key comparisons between strong and weak auctions is the delta okay and this is crucial So, what you're going to see in a weak auction, again if I can illustrate it with the first half of this chart, is you're going to see the delta remain relatively muted, so no real net change in the delta showing us that there's no real initiative being taken from buyers or sellers. So, as we mentioned, when there's a strong auction, i.e. we're seeing initiative being taken and we're seeing a positive delta response. of type trade, as we can see on the left side of the chart, then the delta barely moves.

What you want to see is when we have a strong auction and we have in the volume as well. And we can see that relative pickup compared to what we've seen in previous weaker auction. Okay, so where you can apply this strategy or where this is going to be applied to down the line it's very simple. We're going to see a lot of this concept of strong and weak auctions when we talk about the absorption and auctioning strategy as well as the initiative drive strategy and the failed break of support. and resistance strategy. Okay, so that's our first principle discussed. Let's now have a look at another important principle, trend. Okay, something we talk about, a word we throw around quite a lot, the markets are trending. Did you see that trend today? But what in fact is a trend and how do we identify a trend? Now, What you're going to notice over all these slides is that I'm not going to merely just state a trend is something, I'm going to show you the objective facts from the market so that you can learn to identify trend on facts rather than opinion. So what is trend? Okay, so you look at a market, as you can see on the chart, and there's a general directional bias in the market, so it's moving in one direction and can be easily observed. Okay, the second thing, one-time auctioning, again we mentioned one-time framing, so one-time auctioning again is the exact same concept where we cannot take out the previous high Okay, now, to just include in terms of that, in that auctioning process, when we have Trend, we are exhibiting a very strong auction process, you know, where... the market is moving and navigating in one direction quite aggressively. In other words, there's quite a lot of control and I think that's that's a key word to almost highlight is trend is nothing more than control. It's one side, whether it's bio-sellers in control of the market and the direction of price.

Mistake people make, they tend to think that when markets are trending there's low liquidity. That isn't the case, you can see trend in both high and low liquidity markets. key characteristics you tend to find when a market is trending and this is something that I learned very early on in my career. It's something we call shallow pullbacks. So what does that mean? Now again I know I've obviously got the footprint in front of us but what a shallow pullback is, is in essence We can see if this is one candle, ultimately the market fails to sustain any kind of hold within that previous rotation, so it's really shallow as opposed to something like this. It's almost like if we were to put a percentage on a fib retracement or something, maybe like a 38.2%, so the market's unable to retrace even 38.2% of the previous rotation. Now again, this shallow is a really relative term, but what you can see very clearly in this example is, as this market is going down, it's really failing to get any meaningful bid into the previous rotation. We can see in this example right here, it pretty much opens, so it closes on the low and the very next candle opens on the low and sells off again. Okay, so that's one of the key proponents of of-trend, it's really shallow pullbacks, and the purpose of that, and this is what's so important about the footprint, is that the interaction, i.e. when we have a shallow pullback, it's showing us the aggressive nature of the interaction between the buyers and sellers. It's not allowing any participants in. So as this market is rising and coming back, sellers are so aggressive, they're so intentional that they're willing to hit at very, very extreme prices. Now one of the key rules of thumb again is that if a market is not allowing participants By that very nature, participants are thus being forced to be aggressive in nature. In other words, if the market won't allow them a passive entry, it means that anyone wanting to sell needs to be aggressive rather. In other words, they need to hit the market. And that's why when we do see trend, we tend to see trend continue for longer and longer and longer. Why? Because participants are desperately trying to get in and unfortunately they have to go to the market rather than wait for the market to come to them.

Again, you can see this on the footprint, but I'm going to illustrate it for you first. So what it looks like simply is you get the initial drive and... Okay, so you get the initial drive, the market then has a shallow pullback, and we get this sort of accumulation phase, okay, also known as responsive price action. So we get the initiative, then we get the responsive, then we get the initiative again, and responsive and initiative. So like I said, it's drive, absorb, drive, absorb, and this pattern continues almost for an entire session, you know, in very good trending markets. You can see it here, we get the market selling off, we then get the absorption, you can see the dark shades, we then get the continuation and again the darker shades, we then get the continuation and again the darker shades and continuation and darker shades. So the light shades are showing us the initiative and then the darker shades are Alright, now one of the key tools you can use, and this is where I do think moving averages are particularly good, is a study that you can add to your footprint or your candlesticks is a moving average. You should all know this by now, but a moving average does represent lagging information. However, it does keep us on the right side of trend, or at least if we're not seeing the trend clearly and not picking up on the characteristics that I'm showing you, prompts us to recognize the fact that you know there is very strong price direction. Now it's very simple in terms of a moving average the slope effectively reflects the nature of the trend. So a steeper slope reflects a stronger trend whereas a shallower slope obviously reflects maybe not as strong as a trend. Okay then if we talk about the next characteristic And this is again a lovely little rule of thumb, and I've got a nice expression for this. Sorry, let's go over this point first. So, like I said earlier, an aggressive entry reduces the risk. So, in this strategy, okay, and we're going to talk a lot about trend strategies when we talk about initiative, but in this strategy, ultimately, by being aggressive, okay, so being an aggressive trader in a trending market, Why?

So a steeper slope reflects a stronger trend whereas a shallower slope obviously reflects maybe not as strong as a trend. Okay then if we talk about the next characteristic And this is again a lovely little rule of thumb, and I've got a nice expression for this. Sorry, let's go over this point first. So, like I said earlier, an aggressive entry reduces the risk. So, in this strategy, okay, and we're going to talk a lot about trend strategies when we talk about initiative, but in this strategy, ultimately, by being aggressive, okay, so being an aggressive trader in a trending market, Why?

So it's about being able to differentiate between the two and apply yourself accordingly. Do note, obviously, I'm going to throw around words like a neutral delta or a lower relative volume. Just remember, everything with the footprint tool is in relative terms. It's all good and me while saying, well, 107 is low delta, but it must be low delta relative to what we've seen in this market. That's the key, guys.

Okay, the lighter shades represent a lower change in Delta, whereas the darker shades represent higher change in Delta.

There's no initiative being taken on either side. Low volume and a lot of overlap. Low volume and low delta. Now in terms of absorption that's very different. Absorption actually tends to have very high volume. It tends to have relatively high delta. And then most importantly, consolidation doesn't necessarily consolidate and then move one way or the other. Consolidation tends to just continue consolidating and balancing whereas absorption when a market is absorbing, once they break either side they then tend to initiate or trend in that direction. We will talk about this principle a little bit later on when we get to the absorption principle. is that when we do have this consolidation the markets can move in between this idea of initiative and responsive, so they can keep, you know, we can initiate then respond then maybe initiate, then initiate, then respond initiate, respond, initiate, respond. So the markets continue this process of initiating and responding over a period of time. Okay, so where are we going to see this idea of consolidation? Well you're going to see it pretty much in every single strategy, okay. Consolidation is just a general principle term for when the markets are moving sideways, low volume, low delta, not a great deal of interaction. Okay, so in terms of the example, what you can see in the EURUSDFX here is again to what you will tend to see. A lot of light colors. You'll tend to see darker colors maybe at the extreme points. You'll see just really really difficult price action, i.e. no real clear trend either to the upside or downside. Now the next major principle we're going to talk about and again it's a principle I feel very important we discuss because again I feel like this concept of support and resistance gets utilized extensively but a lot of the time in the wrong manner. So what is support and resistance? To answer that question you actually need to answer the question of what is creating an extreme point, whether at price point R or price point S.

Support is a lot more than just the low. That's what we're going to talk about. We're going to talk about three different types of support and resistance. The question you need to be able to answer is When we get to, say, a resistance, is the market resisting because buyers are no longer willing to buy there, or is it resisting because sellers want to sell there, or is it resisting because buyers want to take profit? What is the real reason behind why the market is stopping at that point that we call resistance? So if you really want to understand support and resistance, you need to learn to understand the interaction taking place at that price point. And those are the three examples I'm going to show you. One of the key things to note is the price response, okay? That's what I'm getting at is that real good support and resistance shows you a very unique specific price response, and I'll show you what that looks like in a minute, okay? A lot of it has got to do with the volume structure Okay, high volume versus low volume, and if I was to just bring it back to the basic sense, when we spoke about the auction process, remember we said that sellers will always interact aggressively when the markets get to a premium, and likewise buyers will always interact aggressively when we get to a discount. So a lot of the time we interpret resistance as premium when it isn't. So market may just come up here, we see the buyers take profits, but we still call that a premium price because we're calling it resistance. In the case of where buyers are simply taking profits, that isn't premium prices. In the case where sellers actually do step in and initiate prices back down, that price action, that we can call premium. Why? Because sellers are stepping in to take advantage of premium prices, not buyers stepping in and taking profits. Okay, and that's the key difference that you need to learn, and that's the examples I'm going to show you. So the first one is what we call a key auction reversal. In other words, it's initiative taken from, let's say, the buyers, and the minute it gets to premium prices, we see initiative being taken from sellers. It looks a little bit like this. we call this an inverse V-reversal or in the case of where the market comes and finds buyers and buyers initiate we call that a V-reversal.

Okay, the second type of price response you can get is what we call an exhaustion high or low. In other words, the market gets to a certain price point, it's absolutely exhausted. As a result, we tend to see a response coming from sellers. Okay, and a lot of the time that response in this example will be profit taking. Okay, now obviously this is slightly relative to the key auction reversal. Now the third type of support and resistance is the failed break support and resistance. A lot of you call this a head fake or you'll know there's a head fake and very simply it's where we're seeing a responsive responsive type price action. Where you can apply the strategy quite a lot is key auction reversals, that is towards the latter half of the course, breakout trading definitely, failed breaks of support and resistance as well as exhaustion highs and lows. Okay, let's look at a few examples now so we can get an idea of these three different types of support and resistance points. So what I've done again, I've just put a nice little chart here, it's nothing more than just the oil and what we can see again, traditionally people go and they put a line there and they say okay well that's support and they put a line there and they say that's resistance. But it's a little bit more important and this is where the footprint is so key. We want to drill into this area and this area and we want to drill into these areas is this a discount price or is it merely sellers taking profit and is this a premium price or is this genuinely where the sellers or the buyers are taking profit. That's the key, that's the nuance that we're looking for. The first one we're going to look at is this example of a key auction reversal. What it looks like on a footprint is one, the first most important thing is we spoke and we said it'll be relatively high volume and volatility. Now what we can see in this example is that there is quite a lot of volatility, quite a lot of range expansion. Now obviously we haven't quite got to the principle of volatility yet but for now, volatility just simply means range expansion or rotation expansion. In other words this is a very large rotation in terms of prices.

Okay, let's look at a few examples now so we can get an idea of these three different types of support and resistance points. So what I've done again, I've just put a nice little chart here, it's nothing more than just the oil and what we can see again, traditionally people go and they put a line there and they say okay well that's support and they put a line there and they say that's resistance. But it's a little bit more important and this is where the footprint is so key. We want to drill into this area and this area and we want to drill into these areas is this a discount price or is it merely sellers taking profit and is this a premium price or is this genuinely where the sellers or the buyers are taking profit. That's the key, that's the nuance that we're looking for. The first one we're going to look at is this example of a key auction reversal. What it looks like on a footprint is one, the first most important thing is we spoke and we said it'll be relatively high volume and volatility. Now what we can see in this example is that there is quite a lot of volatility, quite a lot of range expansion. Now obviously we haven't quite got to the principle of volatility yet but for now, volatility just simply means range expansion or rotation expansion. In other words this is a very large rotation in terms of prices.

And again I don't want to explain it in too much detail because we are going to cover this later on in the unit. Now the basic premise, how it will look, you will always tend to dark colors around the low. So really key auction reversal lows you'll get dark colors down at the low. Why? Because it's first a response. In other words, the market is selling off quite aggressively, it's desperately searching for liquidity, and suddenly it runs into a response. These are passive buyers, market makers, whatever it may be, but the market responds to that discounted price. Once it responds to that discounted price, we then see buyers not just remain responsive, but also become more initiative. So they step in and they initiate trade. rotation, is that initially the market absorbs and straight away buyers say, well we want to be buying higher prices. Now within this process of buying higher prices, you can still see a lot of dark shades and all that is, is that as buyers are buying off a low, we still have sellers that are desperately trying to get out. Why? Because the market has quickly moved away in terms of price. there are a lot of potential sellers caught and they simply providing liquidity for buyers to buy up prices higher, okay? And that's all we're seeing, we're seeing buyers simply absorbing the remaining sell side price action, okay? And slowly but surely as those sellers start to get their fill, as those sellers positions become complete, we then start to see the buyers step up the price action and continue to initiate prices Now note this initiation or this V reversal as we spoke about will continue, in other words the top of the V will only come once those buyers run into again responsive sellers. And that's what we're ultimately seeing here, we're seeing the market at higher prices run into responsive sellers and again note what we see, a nice high pick up in the Okay, so that's what a general V-shape reversal will look like.

So it's a case of the market comes down and it's not really that sellers are maybe taking profit, it's just they're no longer willing to be aggressive at these prices, okay.

It's merely just a pricing area where the market is reluctant to initiate and that's the key word. In the first example we could see that there was real genuine buying coming in. Why? Because prices were at a relative discount. In this onto this price point, but it does not call it, it's not necessarily support just because the market cannot get beyond this point.

And that's what the balanced and imbalanced markets are all about. So very simply, a balanced market is simply a market that is within the previous day's It's within the previous day's accepted value area, and we tend to see relatively low volume, low volatility, and a lot of two-way trade. So if I was to illustrate that in terms of a candlestick, if that was the previous day's then all a balanced market is, is it's a market that's simply trading and oscillating within that previous day's balanced area.

Now, if the market opens lower and opens out of balance, there's a lot of buyers that are now caught off-side. Okay, so by that very definition, those buyers have an option to do one of three things.

Suddenly it sends a signal to be short, and suddenly it rotates the other way. A lot of chop, a lot of two-way trade, and a lot of lack of certainty in terms of direction. What you will also find as you can see in terms of the delta or the delta day or the cumulative delta is we do tend to see a relatively neutral delta throughout a balanced session as you can see in the, this looks like the pound versus the dollar. Let's look at another example now of what an imbalanced market looks like. So very simply we can see the market opened up towards the top half. We then sort of sat on the top half all day and eventually the market went for the breakout. This is the key proponent is that a market can sit in the top range of the previous day for some time and then when the timing is right, when those signals get sent and and obviously the extension and aggression to the upside.

Okay so remember we said the whole purpose of the footprint is we want to learn and understand the interaction taking place between Not only do you get a market that's trading in balance or balanced, but you also get within each individual rotation, you get an imbalance between the way buyers are executing and the way sellers are executing.

Now, again, I will show you in the course how to differentiate between these three. Okay, now note just one last thing, imbalances do create very key markers. Okay, as I said, obviously imbalances will show us if markets are moving quite aggressively higher as in this example, the imbalances will show us that we want to remain with that trend. Okay, so it sets a key marker in the market. Equally, we know that that imbalance equals a strong buy-side response, so by that nature once that buy-side response is taken out, we do tend to get trade in the opposite direction. That's why we mark them, that's why we utilize the footprint tool to find these types of imbalances. Alright, and where we're going to apply this strategy is in the auction imbalance section of the course. Market context. Again, something that not enough traders spend time on, but very simply, market context is nothing other than the nature of the market. What is the nature of my market? Just like you look outside when you go to work in the morning, you say to yourself, what is the day like? Is it going to be warm? Is it going to be cold? Is it going to be windy? Is it going to be sunny? And you make necessary adjustments. You take an umbrella, you take some shades, you take a jersey or you don't. It's no different in the market. yet we don't, you know, we don't look at the market context enough. Okay, so what are some of the basic, you know, proponents of market context? Well first and foremost is volume. Okay, now you need to know what is your market doing at this point in time? Is it showing high volume? Is it showing low volume? Is it showing high volume at highs of days? Is it showing low volume at lows of days? Okay, so you need to analyze the market in terms of where volume is coming in. Then, flow dynamics. How is the market flowing? A lot of the time we look at a market and there's one big green day or one big trend and we assume the market just went in a straight line. But if you go and look at it and you actually go and drill it down and look at the footprints, it might be something like this where the market rarely has a", "transcript": "which they're executing. Now, if buyers suddenly start changing the way they're executing, we need to be aware of that because it provides potential opportunities. Don't worry too much about what those opportunities are, but in a basic sense, as a rule of thumb, you get an imbalance. You don't want to be fading it. You actually want to remain with the trend. Equally, once the market starts to fill into that imbalance, it then tends to fill it out and we tend to see a little bit of two-way trade within that imbalance. Again, I will show you a little bit of a later stage. Note it comes from stops, okay, so sometimes you get stops in the market, sometimes you get initiative from both buyers or sellers, alright, becoming more aggressive, and sometimes it can be just simply because of noise.

Then How are buyers and sellers responding? In other words, is the market auctioning up and we get a bit of two-way trade and auctioning up and two-way trade and auctioning up? Or is it again just auctioning, deep retracement, auctioning, shallow retracement, auctioning, deep retracement, etcetera, etcetera. Okay, so what are the auction dynamics like? How are the buyers and sellers auctioning with one another? Are we seeing initiative? Are we seeing responsive? Again, not something we've seen a great deal of in 2017, but markets do open up sometimes. When markets are more volatile, some strategies are going to work better. You're going to have to execute slightly different when there's volatility. On the flip side, when there's low volatility, we have to be more patient. We can't afford to pay up in terms of prices, so we become more passive in our execution. The other thing we need to determine is are our markets being driven by technicals, in which case you know people are price sensitive or are they being driven by flow. Now in flow dynamics what we tend to see is the market doesn't really care much for technicals, it just tends to do whatever it wants. Or are they being driven by fundamentals? For markets being driven by fundamentals you're going to see a very trendy type moves and very aggressive type moves where the market's trying to reprice itself. So it's so important to be able to differentiate between is the market driven by technicals, flows or fundamentals. Then is there trend or no trend in the market? We know why that's important because we spoke about this principle a little Okay, so where we're going to apply this concept to market context is throughout every single one of these strategies that we can observe. Okay, now the next principle is high and low volume, okay, something that's significantly important. Remember, it's not just high and low volume, it's relative high and low volume. Now, if you want to get good at this, you're going to have to start marking down certain things. In other words, every single day, you need to say to yourself, in my market, what was the highest volume traded on a rotation? What was the lowest volume traded on a rotation?

Now note, volume is a function of business activity and most people don't know this. Volume simply tells us there's more participation taking place. Now note, unfortunately as a day trader and a speculative trader, we always tend to assume that all activity is speculative. It isn't. In fact, very little trade in the markets is speculative in nature. So by that very definition, remember, someone who's speculating or speculative in nature tends to be very focused on price and manages risk very specifically. Equally, they execute very specifically, compared to someone who's less price-sensitive or hedging. They're just simply hedging out of position so they're not too concerned about price. One of the most important things to understand is where is it that business activity is taking place? In other words, where is the high and low volume coming in, right? That's the important thing and the most important thing is to say to yourself why, why, why? Why is there high volume here? Why is there low volume here? Alright, one of the things you're going to learn when we talk about breakout strategies is that what you need to see is I want to see high volume on the breakout. Why? Because high volume shows me a lot of participation. Now by the definition of a breakout, a breakout means that we're seeing not just buyers buying through highs but we're also seeing sellers get out of their short positions. so if everyone is buying there should be a high amount of business activity and we should see high volume so if we don't we gotta say why why why all right now as a rule of thumb again a rule of thumb high volume tends to accompany trend okay low volume tends to accompany distribution Now, one of the most important things is don't fade divergences. One of the, again, these hocus pocus things that they teach you in these very elementary courses is this idea of when these divergences fade, i.e. markets are trending, but they're trending on lower volume. Now what I am going to say to you is a market is trending because it's trying to find price. It's in a discovery mode of finding price. Now, when a market is trying to find price, it can keep finding that price until such a point that someone is willing to sell it.

So important, don't fade divergences, however, observe the outlier. So observe when that divergence exists, make a note of it and I will show you at some point what you can look at on the footprint to trade these sorts of divergences. Never fade flow. Basically with thumb we spoke about that in the trend principle. Don't fade the flows. Why? Because they tend to take a long time to turn around and can be very costly. Now note, relative volume is paramount to interpretation, I've explained that. And in terms of where we're going to apply this, we're going to apply this everywhere. The principle of high and low volume is going to be applied throughout. Now, in terms of the basic example, I just want to show you the relative shifts. We can see really, really low volume here. As you can see, nice light colors showing us that relative low volume compared to the rest of the session. We then suddenly get quite a nice pick up, dark colors, illustrating that real pick up in the change in Delta. Now, in terms of relative, you know, you can see that the shift is from 832 in this rotation to suddenly 1893, so a real aggressive shift in the relative change of volume. Now, with that in mind, just keep note, okay? I showed you two types of footprint rotations, one is time-based, okay, and the other Now, so important to make a note of this. If you are setting your footprint charts to time-based, you can then look at these metrics on a relative basis. Why? Because you're comparing Apple A with Apple A. If these however are rotations, you cannot compare volume on a relative term. Why? Because you're comparing Apple A with Apple B. Okay, so it's so important when you're dealing with rotations, the relative term of volume and delta isn't as important, whereas when you're referring to time, the relative changes are a lot more important. Okay, and again, as you'll see, I will explain to you, and I will show you within each one of the strategies, when's it better to use either a rotation or either a time. And you'll understand why it's better to use a rotation or time in the various strategies. The next principle we're going to focus on is volatility. Again, volatility does not mean trend.

Now one of the greatest tools for that It doesn't give us a trade opportunity, it just shows us the market volatility has picked up. So like I said, volatility does not imply volume, so just because a market is more volatile doesn't mean there's going to be more volume. In theory there should be, why? Because like we said, when price moves very far, or when prices break out and become imbalanced, then we should see a pick up in volume. as a rule of thumb, okay, when we have volatility in an imbalanced market, okay, let me erase this, so when we have volatility in an imbalanced market you're going to see a high amount of volume. When we have volatility in a balanced market we can still see relatively low volume. And that's the key. Where is that volatility occurring? And that's why we talk or we spoke about the principle of trade location or market context. Because the context of the market is crucial to understanding where we could see volatility and where we could see higher or lower volume. Why does volatility occur? Well it's very simple. The participation ranges. Okay, so it's very simple as a basic example. Let's say it's 130 non-farm payrolls. We know it's a relatively large data piece. What happens? Well, the entire order book disappears. Okay, why? Well, because no one wants to take the risk. So the participation changing simply creates more volatility. Once the number comes out, obviously all those automated programs come in first, then maybe we see the flows from the big institutions and that's what's creating the volatility. It's the change in nature of participants coming in and out of the market. Okay now, obviously We tend to see pick up in volatility when there's big risk events, we tend to see volatility when maybe markets move beyond certain price points. So again it's so important to understand, if a market breaks out of maybe a five year resistance point or high, of course there is potential for higher volatility. Why? Because the nature of participants are changing. those potential triggers. Like I said to you, if we have a five-year high there is potential for a shift in volatility so we want to be prepared for that shift and ultimately make sure that we apply the applicable strategies when we see that shift in volatility.

Some of the key places you will see pickups in volatility obviously when we have key central bank decisions or key economic data when markets gap open either higher or lower or when we see potential stop runs in various markets. Okay, now just to illustrate to you a good example of volatility, this is the gold market quite recently and what we can see is we had a real good selloff in the market. It sold off almost a good 50 ticks and again sucked in a lot of participants. You know, and more importantly we had quite a strong positive delta on the day reflecting maybe more buy side positioning and all of a sudden the market just reversed on a dime, okay. Ultimately we can see also, look at the number of imbalances here. Lots of imbalances going through the market when it was showing us potential for short side trades. The market then obviously got or stopped out anyone short, maybe got a few people long and then reversed in the opposite direction again. Real volatility, but note, this volatility doesn't occur outside of a range, it actually Okay so that's kind of why I wanted to show you this chart. Volatility doesn't necessarily have to come in the form of inside the previous day or in balanced markets. It can also be in balanced and inbalanced. The next principle is initiative and responsive price action, so I'm going to go through this with you, I'm going to explain this again and I'm going to talk about this in terms of obviously order flow dynamics. So order flow dynamics is simply just trend, volume and delta. Now initiative is where buyers or sellers step in and they initiate the price to move in one direction. Why do they do this? Let's use a very practical example. Goldman Sachs, they get an order early on on a Monday morning and some pension fund wants Goldman Sachs to execute 10,000 lots. Now Goldman Sachs has to execute that in the most efficient manner possible. Now one of two things can happen. Goldman Sachs enters the market, they begin the process of buying. Now, if someone is willing to sell and respond to Goldman Sachs, provide Goldman Sachs with liquidity, then what's likely to happen is the market is likely to buy until they find that liquidity, in which case we start to see the market move sideways. However, once that liquidity runs out, Goldman Sachs still has to finish that order so they continue the process of buying. And again, they'll go in search and they'll keep buying until they find the necessary Now, what can happen sometimes is those orders can simply be met straight away with the liquidity and we get something like this. So we get the market coming up and it gets hit back down. Comes up, gets hit back down.", "transcript": "we want to be prepared for that shift and ultimately make sure that we apply the applicable strategies when we see that shift in volatility.

Ultimately we can see also, look at the number of imbalances here. Lots of imbalances going through the market when it was showing us potential for short side trades. The market then obviously got or stopped out anyone short, maybe got a few people long and then reversed in the opposite direction again. Real volatility, but note, this volatility doesn't occur outside of a range, it actually Okay so that's kind of why I wanted to show you this chart. Volatility doesn't necessarily have to come in the form of inside the previous day or in balanced markets. It can also be in balanced and inbalanced. The next principle is initiative and responsive price action, so I'm going to go through this with you, I'm going to explain this again and I'm going to talk about this in terms of obviously order flow dynamics. So order flow dynamics is simply just trend, volume and delta. Now initiative is where buyers or sellers step in and they initiate the price to move in one direction. Why do they do this? Let's use a very practical example. Goldman Sachs, they get an order early on on a Monday morning and some pension fund wants Goldman Sachs to execute 10,000 lots. Now Goldman Sachs has to execute that in the most efficient manner possible. Now one of two things can happen. Goldman Sachs enters the market, they begin the process of buying. Now, if someone is willing to sell and respond to Goldman Sachs, provide Goldman Sachs with liquidity, then what's likely to happen is the market is likely to buy until they find that liquidity, in which case we start to see the market move sideways. However, once that liquidity runs out, Goldman Sachs still has to finish that order so they continue the process of buying. And again, they'll go in search and they'll keep buying until they find the necessary Now, what can happen sometimes is those orders can simply be met straight away with the liquidity and we get something like this. So we get the market coming up and it gets hit back down. Comes up, gets hit back down.", "ocr_text": null, "visual_caption": null, "metadata": {"chunk_idx": 22, "frame_refs": ["output/THE_KEY_FOOTPRINT_TRADING_PRINCIPLES___PART_A/frames/scene_0014_end.jpg", "output/THE_KEY_FOOTPRINT_TRADING_PRINCIPLES___PART_A/frames/scene_0015_start.jpg"]}}

So we get the market coming up and it gets hit back down. Comes up, gets hit back down. Comes back and so forth and so forth. Now, in this example, this is perfect for Goldman Sachs. Why? Because they're not having to move prices too far and they're getting their fill relatively easily. Goldman Sachs can't even get any liquidity and the markets very quickly navigate higher. And this is all it is. Initiative is just simply an order being initiated. The markets are initiating some sort of a move, whether that's an order, whether that's a break of a key level, it's initiative. Buyers are taking the initiative to move prices higher or sellers are taking the initiative to move prices lower. Now, as prices move up and down, people are going to respond to those prices, and they're going to respond for a number of reasons. Maybe they feel it's discounted premium, maybe they feel the market's gone too far, maybe some short-term strategies, maybe some hedging, but as prices move, we get responsive type behavior. Now, the three general types of price patterns you're going to see is the first one, The second is just simply responsive-responsive and the third is initiative-initiative. Now before I show it to you in the footprint I'm just going to illustrate it for you. So initiative-responsive-initiative is simply initiative taken, the market responds to the higher price and we initiate again and respond and initiate. That's the first type. The second type is responsive-responsive. and simply we see response from sellers moves down, we see response from buyers moves up, moves down, moves up. Now what's the difference between the first and the second? Well, in this example what's happening is that as price is moving up the buyers are backing out of those longs and selling and equally the sellers are responding to the high. So the first thing is as price comes up we run into sellers who are responding Same thing happens when we get to the low. We first run into responsive buyers and once those responsive buyers start to buy the market up, those sellers then to take profit and the market moves back up and so forth and so forth. So the nature of price action in terms of responsive-responsive is very different and unique to that of initiative-responsive initiative. Now, the third type, which is one of the most aggressive, which is what I illustrated to you in the very strong V-reversal, inverse V-reversal, is where we get initiative taken and initiative in the opposite direction.

We can see the market runs into that liquidity and then straight away the sellers step it up and they sell back down. We can see those sellers stepping it up. Why? Because initially we get the response from sellers. see obviously that very dark color scheming. And then the market starts to sell back down.

And that's the key, is that we can see a great deal more initiative being taken from the sellers than being taken from the buyers. Now, you say to yourself, well, why are there so many buyers there? Well, it's very simple. When the markets come up such a long way in an initiative fashion, there's going to be a lot of shorts that are caught off-side.

Once that secondary buying is done, in other words they've been cleared out, notice what we get. We get real initiative being taken from the sellers. Again, notice how the sellers are hitting every one of the bids versus buyers doing absolutely nothing. Okay, and obviously in terms of price response, we get that very, very beautiful inverse V shape. In terms of just volume and all that, again like I said this is one of the highest volume principles you're going to see. We do tend to see very very large pickup in volume but also we tend to see a large pickup in volume on the reverse side. That is the key to an initiative. It is initiative high volume in the one direction and again in the opposite direction. Now, very traditionally and typically as a rule of thumb, any delta that accumulates on the way up will effectively unwind on the way down. Okay, now if you look at the right side example, this is more a bit of a sort of a responsive response. So what we can see is the market comes down, we see lower prices being absorbed, market You know, a lot of two-way trade, someone accumulating the market. Once that accumulation has taken place, note we get a little bit of a pushback higher. The market runs into higher prices. We then get, again, the consolidation taking place at the high, a lot of absorption, and the market then begins responding to those higher prices. The market then obviously rotates back lower, and again, we see those buyers responding And that's the real key difference is as the market comes down, we watch for that response being taken from the buyers, they start passively buying the market, once it starts to go back up the sellers take profit and that's what creates that rotation to the upside. So that's our basic understanding of initiative and responsive price action. Alright, now our last two little principles of this part A of unit 3, high volume and low volume errors.

Now that's important because we always have to ask ourselves why was there so much participation taking place at this point? What was it that brought the buyers and the sellers together to participate in this manner? Alright, and those interaction points, you know, we want to identify who's taken the liquidity and who's provided it. Now this is a really key thing to understand, okay?

In balanced markets we also need to ask why is there no liquidity being provided?
