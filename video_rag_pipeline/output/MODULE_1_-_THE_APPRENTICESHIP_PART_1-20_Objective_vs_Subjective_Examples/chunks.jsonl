The Fed initiated the first hike in December 2015, historic. Now remember what we said, in theory, when rates rise or interest rates are pushed up higher by the Federal Reserve, we should see longer term yields rise as well. In theory. Note the Greenspan conundrum, the last time we saw this, it didn't occur according to theory. So, what do you think happened this time around when the Fed initiated the first hike in 2015? Well, first and foremost, 10-year treasury yields, as depicted in the red line, traded at 2.06 the day the Federal Reserve signalled a rate hike in October 2015. Remember, they signalled in October, they hiked in December. Currently, as of October 2016, we can see yields are at 1.6%, almost one full calendar So, what does this tell us? Well, it tells us that yes, in theory, history does give us good ideas, it does give us a sense of subjectivity, however, had we relied on that subjectivity again in this instance, just like the Greenspan Conundrum, we would have lost money again. Note how the market sold off quite aggressively this year, or in 2016, ever since the Federal So, are you confused? Well you shouldn't be, because so long as you remain objective in your approach, in your analysis, it's okay to take these trades on. If you took the trade on for higher yields, it's okay, it's a good trade. However, just ensure that you have objectivity to protect you in the event that the markets don't react or respond", "transcript": "Let's take a look now at the 2015 rate hike cycle.
