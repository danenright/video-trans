Now when we have these day types I tend to have sort of two ideas as to what can occur over the course of the day. in theory, remain intact. So the reason I draw this volume profile is to ensure that I constantly remind myself as to that initiative that's taken place over the early part of the day. Remember what we spoke about in module one and two when we spoke about initiative versus responsive? And we said that when there's initiative there tends to be a natural bias towards one side of the market. In this example that natural bias is towards the downside. Now again as you'll see with the composite profile is that it helps me to one, determine where the good trade location is which is ahead of the area of low trade where that first orange line is And then more importantly, it helps me to remain in the trade until such a time that we find discount prices. And we can see once we've found those discount prices, the market very quickly auctions back up towards the top orange line. So again, we can see how volume profiling over a composite time frame can aid us in not just decision making, not just staying in the right trade for longer, not just keeping us on the right side with the right idea in mind.
