And what we're going to be looking at here is what's called the gold double whammy play. And we're going to be looking at momentum but we're going to mix this up again which is going to include a reversal play as well. What we'll be looking at is a momentum plan. How are we going to execute it now? The momentum play for gold over here is actually specifically looking at this daily level I think it was a double inside day break your classic chart on the daily chart where you expect there to be potentially some stops to be run towards the downside once it trades out this 1262 area. And as the patent type says here, it's a multi-day breakout zone. So this is where you more or less prepare your charts, but it's what really happens afterwards that's actually the exciting part where none of your charts would be able to tell you this except your price ladder. classic stop-hunter approach. So you'd be looking to put a passive limit order or limit order over here on the sell side, looking for those stops to be triggered. But because the volume's also picking up here, you could also execute a potential volume slam dunk play. You know, one of the slam dunk plays that we were talking about earlier on, that you wanna, excuse me, you wanna be able to ensure that as the volume the volume activity and the auctioning speed starts picking up, you're protected by the auctioning initiative from the sellers, so you could either have a volume slam dunk or your stop hunter player where you have a sell order at just below the level potentially or at the level or you know a little bit above it depending on where you think the stops will be triggered and this is a process of observation in time and recording observation time in order to maximize the specific market you're The ladder market environment for a stop plate can be high or low volume, and the volatility is not important because you're just trying to locate the stop area. If it's a volume slam dunk, the volatility and the volume, well, the volume is incredibly important, and so is the auctioning activity and the auctioning speed. You want to see a lot of good auctioning initiative going on just prior to the breakout because if there's good auctioning initiative, prior to the breakout there's a greater chance of the market moving, if it starts trading down here and it's losing momentum, becoming lethargic, well then a volume slam dunk player is not the ideal player that you want to execute, you'd rather wait and actually the 1262 with a line with your passive bits to exit.", "transcript": "Okay, so now let's look at a price ladder play and a momentum play that is in the gold market.

Now we're going to have a look at this. We're going to have a look of when the market stops through and then we're going to make some really clear observation of a blowout attack reversal pattern. So the reversal pattern which will look at a couple of light low volume nodes where the market kind of exhausts itself after the push and what that exhaustion looks towards the upside. So it's a bit of an advanced pattern that we're looking at, but it becomes less advanced the more you practice and the more you see it in your own personal observations. So let's have a look here of when the market is trading in real time. So if you just bear with me, let's put it on play and let's look at the activity. So you can see over here the markets, you know trading at the moment. There we go. Now they're the stop So you've noticed the stop So, there's a stop just below that level. We stopped down all the way to 1260, so around a 20 tick move. And as you can see, this 20 tick move, we've left a little bit of a light volume zone over here. So, let's have a look at this and this observation. And as you become more accustomed to the ladder, you'll be able to pick these up really quickly, really dynamically in real time. So, you can see nothing really traded over here. very large and you can see by the shape of the delta on the trading technology it's a complete 454 lot sell so that was a stop that was executed but the market traded straight back above so the markets traded straight back above we've got this low volume zone over here so if you're looking for low volume passive entry then you'd probably want to start executing it brings alarm bells to me is that we've got a low volume zone over here and you also have a light volume zone over here but you have this big order over here and the market immediately is rejected so that's a potential blowout reversal pattern that we're looking at so now if we have a look at this market trade at the moment you'll start seeing As the market's trading, you'll start seeing it moves away from this area very quickly and trades at original low-volume zones.

So firstly, the market's immediately telling me that it's struggling on the downside, and we've left this low-volume zone and we already traded through the previous low-volume zone, so immediately the buyers have taken control over here. So the fact that the buyers have taken over, we've left this low-volume zone over here, we traded through... this low volume zone over here and we're holding the bit side so the entries for the for the volume reversal is you want to start distributing your clip so effectively how you want to start distributing your clip you want to start positioning yourself anywhere so above this at this price, only 52 lots being traded. So you want to start positioning your clip if you feel this is a blowout reversal because of the low volume node and the fact that we traded through over here and we're trading near enough the breakout point.

You can see that the markets is oscillating so it's offering down, see some buyers keep on stepping in so you know you could distribute one clip over here, you know a couple of clips so it keeps on coming back to the 1261 and someone sits in, kind of keeps on reloading the bid.
