Let's first define what momentum means. When it comes to momentum strategies we are most likely to see quite an array of timeframe participants from the algorithms to the day traders, to the short term traders, even the swing traders as well as potentially some initiative timeframe players. So as you can see with momentum players there tends to be a whole host of players that enter the market. Now, What we have to try and understand is whether or not momentum plays are either driven by initiative or by responsive. What do we mean by that? If there is an initiative play coming into the market that creates a momentum play, this kind of momentum is the type that we particularly want to pay attention to because this is the kind of momentum that is unlikely to be counted and will give If, on the other hand, it's responsive type players that are effectively creating a momentum, this is not always necessarily the best opportunity. Why? Because responsive means that, for instance, as prices are moving higher, what's happening is it's actually shorts that are covering their positions that is taking price higher. So this is far more short-lived momentum than what it would be in the case of initiative In terms of the objective or time objective time is crucial when it comes to momentum strategies Momentum is exactly that it's speed and velocity Therefore by definition we shouldn't be spending much time You know at the price that we enter the market so time is a crucial element when it comes to developing your momentum strategies in terms of volume and volatility. By its definition we expect to see a pick-up in both volume and volatility. So what should occur is that as we trade various prices and the momentum picks up, we should see the volume increasing and we should see the price range or at least the volatility within the day pick up as well. Again, if we do not see this, these are early indicators that maybe the momentum is not as strong In terms of risk-reward, well this is one of the categories of strategies that gives almost maximum risk-reward and the reason being is because we enter with very very tight stops. Now what do I mean by that? Remember as we spoke in previous slides I said a stop is placed where the trade idea is no longer valid. In this instance, momentum is exactly that. The minute the momentum disappears and the market cannot go in the direction of the momentum, we exit the trade. We do not wait. If the market does not move in a momentum response like we expect it to, we merely exit.

By having such a tight stop and having almost an open-ended target, this will allow us to take maximum risk-reward opportunity plays. Again, we expect to see a momentum of price. Now what that means is that we shouldn't really see prices sitting constant and static for very long. So we want to see a momentum, we want to see sort of almost a flow within the price response as we take out key points and as we enter our key momentum strategies.
