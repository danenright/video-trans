And what we can see is that not only did it open fractionally below the previous day's most accepted price which is the volume point of control. So we can see this market is kind of opened exactly where it closed on the previous day. So we're firmly in balance. The market is, you know, it's opened and it said well we're still in the same area where we accept the price as the previous day. And again remember what I said to you, when we open in balance there's a high probability the market's going to continue to balance until it gets further As you'll see in this example, the market had an almost completely overlapping value area.
