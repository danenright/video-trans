Okay, now, you watched that video all about practice and gave you some good ideas about practice and what practice is, but I think it's nicely summarized by Gary Player where he said that the harder you practice, the luckier you get. Now, I want to tell you why practice is so pivotal. Okay, what most people don't realize is that through practice you're going to develop edge. Let's take for example what I've had you doing for the last couple of units where You watch a video we complete the template together you watch a drill and you complete the template on your own Now that is a form of practice Now you got to say well, how are you developing edge by completing that form every day? Well, it's simple Let's say that over a series of 10 examples. You found that in the one strategy volume Is always high When there's a favorable outcome and always low When there's a poor outcome guess what you've just developed. Okay through practice You've developed edge Now that's the purpose of practice. It's about developing loads of little edges. Okay constantly developing edge whether that's based on volume time You know the market you're trading the volatility whatever it may be Through observing this day in day out through practicing in this manner. You're developing little edges Okay, ultimately all those little edges together add up to an edge now The template I've provided you with is your practice session. Okay, it's a very very Specifically guided practice session, right? I'm putting the ball down and I'm telling you kick free kicks for me now and for the next 45 minutes And that's all you're doing and you're kicking free kicks for the next however many days it takes. That's the purpose of not just the templates, but that's the purpose of practice, is to get you proficient at kicking free kicks.

I've spoken about this for quite a bit now over the last couple of slides. Initiative as we've said it is exactly what the word said it initiates as someone steps in and we initiate in the market. Now this initiation okay will look like trend so the usual characteristics will be there will have high volume, high delta, high volatility and ultimately imbalances. Okay, imbalances, low volume areas, etc, etc. Now the most important thing to understand about initiative drive is the principle behind why an initiative drive occurs. To focus on that, let's go back one step and let's talk a little bit about the context where you can expect to see initiative drives. The first is the open drive. Now for those of you This will be no secret this trade strategy to you, you'll know this strategy very well. The profile does show in a very, very specific way what an open drive looks like. However, an open drive is just simply a time-based initiation, i.e. the cash open. Okay, now this can be the cash open of any markets. In the oil market, we're looking at 1.30 p.m. when the pits open in Chicago. In terms of the currencies, we're also looking at 8 a.m., and in terms of the U.S. bonds, around 1.20. So it all depends on the cash open. Now the first type of initiative you get is on the open drive. Now that initiative will look slightly different, and have a slightly different nuance to the initiative drive taken in the middle of the session. So that's the second one. So that could be any time, that could be a couple of minutes after the open, a couple of minutes towards the close. Now they're both going to show very similar characteristics.", "transcript": "but that's the purpose of practice, is to get you proficient at kicking free kicks.

Now they're both going to show very similar characteristics. The main distinct difference is the initiative will obviously go from the beginning of the cash open, whereas obviously the second one will happen at a slightly different time. But the one that occurs at the cash open, initially we do tend to see quite a lot of imbalances. Why? We're going to use Goldman Sachs as an example because they rule the world. So Goldman Sachs has prepped the night before. They want to sell 25,000 contracts or they want to buy 25,000 contracts at the market at the open of the European session and they're going to do it as soon as the liquidity is being provided, i.e. cash open means that liquidity is available. Why? Because all the banks are now officially trading. So Goldman Sachs makes the decision, they're going to execute on the open. Now what tends to happen is that a lot of the time it's not just Goldman Sachs wanting to execute this, okay, and that's probably why we tend to get the initial imbalance. In other words, we get the spike up, the initiative, imbalance created, the market eventually finds liquidity, okay, so remember an initiative drive is simply about initiative, it needs to run into responsive selling. Okay, this response of selling is nothing more than sellers providing liquidity to the market now Once it finds that response of selling bear in mind Okay, Goldman Sachs has a large order to execute and this is one of the key differences an open drive that occurs at the cash open has a very very high probability of continuation a Initiative drive that occurs midpoint in the session has a far lower probability of continuation and that's one of the key differences to identify between the two. Now the reason is very simple. Initially Goldman Sachs is looking for liquidity. They will find some liquidity but once that liquidity, once those sellers have stopped responding to higher prices and the market's backed off a little bit, Goldman Sachs will then need to initiate again. Now the reason we get a much higher probability of extension in the initial period It's far more obvious when there's an open drive at the beginning of the cash session versus middle of the session Okay, you know, it's in the middle of the session. There's been a lot going on There's a lot more of an established range in the market There's a lot more strategies being employed in the market.

So the most important thing is initiative Okay, we might get the imbalance or not. But what I would say if I was to compare the two Okay, if these are both Drive higher imbalances, right the first one will likely see imbalances because it's at the beginning of the session Okay, the second one less likely. Okay to see an imbalance Like I said, obviously there is liquidity being provided and a lot more strategies. So let's call this 8 a.m. open and obviously let's call this 11 a.m. open. Okay, so you can see how context and time can play a very pivotal role in the type of initiative trade you're going to get now. What that means in terms of obviously the trade opportunity is very little, okay, because responsive. The market will then back off and back off. Now in the case of the first example we know there's a high probability of extension. So what we're looking for is we're looking for absorption. Once we find that absorption we're looking to be long. Now remember what I said okay? Goldman Sachs has got 25,000 contracts. That's sort of a size order because they are executing at the beginning of the session they obviously require quite a lot of liquidity. By that nature we're going to extend, there's a high but also they're probably going to extend quite aggressively so what we'll see is the market will drive it'll then enter a sideways mode okay some will call this a flag some will call this an accumulation distribution okay the important thing is once you see this all right you're looking to be a buyer of absorption okay and then you're then looking to add on to a position to pyramid or to get big in a position through the break and extension. This is one of those examples again in terms of execution where we will be looking for some form of a nice aggressive execution. If we look at some of the other principles to focus on in terms of shading, as we mentioned in the absorption and auctioning, we're going to see dark shades at the extreme, dark shades at the extreme.

Now in terms of balanced or imbalanced markets what I would say is initiative is initiative Obviously if it occurs, you know outside of range you know, we can assume that maybe there's going to be more stop up and more rally, but that isn't always the case, okay? So, the imbalance or imbalances is relatively irrelevant. What we're more focused on is what time this occurs, okay? Now, do bear in mind, initiative is created by large time frame participants, okay? So large time frame, okay? Influential The most important thing, if you know there's large timeframe participants entering the market, the last thing you want to do is fade the market. So again, like I say to you in every one of these strategy sessions, it's not necessarily about doing what I say or what the strategy is, but if you observe an initiative drive, just understand that the initiative drive by definition Goldman Sachs with their 25,000 contracts is not price sensitive so all you're doing by selling and selling and selling is you're providing liquidity to a market that is illiquid. So factor that in and don't make the mistake. Obviously liquidity is what ultimately drives the initiative like I said at the start of a session there's probably a lot less liquidity being provided hence why an open Whereas later on the session is more liquidity and that's why it can still extend, it still continues but not always as aggressive. Now note I did mention the imbalances, you'll tend to see imbalances more on the open drives rather than the imbalance or rather than the initiative drive that occurs mid-point in the session.

There is initiative in the market. You will see high volume. You will see high volatility You will see high Delta. Okay now In terms of the trade strategy, this is quite a simple one to execute, and it's quite a lucrative one. You know, these are fantastic when they occur. We've seen, I'd probably say over the course of 2017, we've probably seen about 15 of these in the e-mini S&Ps. Okay, now, if you know that over the last 15 open drives in the e-mini S&P, every single one of them has been successful, okay, so with that sort of a statistic in mind, I mean, you can leverage as much as you want, as much as you're willing to leverage.

Remember, that extension is not based on a level. That extension is not based on my feelings, my thoughts, how big a level it is. That extension is based on when Goldman Sachs decides that the liquidity is up and they need to extend and go to market again. Again, I hope I'm driving home that the markets are not driven by charts or anything other than the interaction between buyers and sellers. The footprint will show us that interaction. Now like I said the tip is to observe this part. That's the tip. Observe this part, observe this part, decide what context it's in, then execute on the first pullback. When you see that absorption and you want to sit long, again what I would say, work There's no exact stop here again, but don't be too tight on a stop here. For me, generally I will use a stop with the same measured amount as this rotation. In other words, if this rotation is 12 ticks, once I enter, I will have probably between an 8 and a 12 tick rotation. Equally, if we do continue to move lower on one of these second rotations, I won't be afraid to buy more. the trade strategy is still in play. Okay then obviously once we do extend if you do want to leverage that's the time to be big once we get that you know sort of leveraged position on just before the extension. Now what I would say again as a little tip in a type of piece of price action what you're going to find is once we get back to this extreme point you're going to see so initially at every one of these highs we're seeing the selling absorption bigger than the buying so we're seeing a lot of sell-side response at these extremes now the moment that flips around the moment we start to see the buyers absorb more than the sellers are selling and you see absorption from the buyers over here that's the market Okay, that's the key to trading us and we'll see that in the charts in the next couple of slides.

I do think this is one of the last ones we actually saw this year, if I'm not mistaken. Now the important thing to note is we obviously started with a high amount of volume, high amount of delta. Sometimes, what is quite tricky about the initiative drive and why it's a patient strategy is that a lot of the time, you have to forgo this. Obviously, if there are other strategies in play, maybe some of your other strategies that are working well that allow you access to this trade or to this move higher, that's brilliant. But in terms of the initiative drive, that first part, we're not interested in. What we are interested in is observing it. Relatively high volume, note the delta, cumulative in terms of the direction. Okay, the market then consolidates. Okay, we get our first pullback. As we can see, we get our first pullback, and once we get that first pullback we are then looking for long-sided trades. Okay, so that's what an initiative drive will look like from the cache open sometimes. It's a lot more directional So sometimes these obviously five five-minute rotations sometimes the first five-minute rotation might even do that Okay, you might even get the first five-minute rotation a pullback and then an extension okay, the concepts the same the principles the same and The manner of execution is the same. Okay. Let's have a look at another example now obviously as another example of the initiative drive So again we can see the market has a drive. This is a mid-day drive now. This is not so much a cash open. This is the oil. Note again five minute rotations. This initiative drive took place in the middle of the day. Just remember what I said middle of the day. Sometimes you will see the extension, the aggressive extension, sometimes not. Now again how we identified, like I said, if you don't have a footprint you'll obviously see a relatively large pickup 13,000 contracts traded, 1,500 contracts, market goes, it extends, finds a bit of responsive selling, backs off, we have the absorption, note what we said, once we have that absorption we're long, we're looking for a stop in terms of that measured move, so somewhere around here, and we're looking for an extension and continuation.

What does that imply? through practicing this time and time again. Now let's take a look at an example in one of the markets and what we're going to look at is the E-Money S&P on the 15th of December and in actual fact I think that this wasn't a cash open drive, this was also a middle of the session. So let's have a look at this and see how this plays out. Now again This is going to start right at the beginning. I'm just going to actually show you the initiative first. You can go watch this entire video back yourself. But the first thing to point out, note the initiative. So we get the open. In fact, sorry, apologies. This is a cash open drive as well. This was taken on the 15th of December, so this was the last cash open drive. We could see straight away as the cash opens 17,000, 18,000 contracts, the market So that's always a very early clue if you get a cash open drive or initiative on the cash open, you're likely to always see those imbalances. Now as you said I'm going to fast forward this to the point where the market enters a sideways balancing. So again this is the key thing, you've got to remember sometimes the markets will take time to move sideways, sometimes they could move sideways straight away. Rotates it higher and higher for a good half an hour in this example Note obviously where the five-minute drive and then we've already seen liquidity being provided So note once the liquidity is being provided. We're looking simply for the absorption there. It is 2300 contracts we then looking for a buy-side trade. Okay, so we now long the market And remember what I said, this can take time to extend. Okay, it's so important and crucial that you understand that the market can take time to extend, so you do have to be very, very patient. And most importantly, respect where your stop is. Okay, respect the trade principle, respect the trade strategy, and ultimately, once the responsive sellers are done providing their liquidity, you'll ultimately see the market then go bid and continue higher. Okay now just a few little observations. Note obviously this is an imbalanced chart so you're not going to quite see it yet but notice the absorption on the bid.

Absorption on the bid. Also note the delta okay so the first time we sold off you know good negative delta again we spoke about this in the in the strategy on highs and lows. So that's a really good example of two strategies combining, a little bit of an exhaustive top. Again, that does not imply that it's the top of the market, it just simply implies the market's taking a breather. Another one of the principles we obviously identified, note the 1500 lot traded at the high, that is a bad high. So again, if we are in the frame of mind that this is initiative drive, we know the probability Because we have a number of strategies and player one the initiative one the auction imbalances Another one the absorption of the low as well as the bad high so it's a real confluence play now the last thing I want to show you is what occurs just before the extension This is the real key to getting good at these two timing them like I said note That's almost a good 30 35 minutes now. You've had to sit in this trade, but you felt no real heat We entered around that 3,000 lot and we felt relatively little heat. Now remember what I said the key tip patience obviously in identifying the strategy but then also patience once you've executed. Now note what we're looking for is we're looking for this sort of absorption coming from the buyers. Why? Every time we've seen sellers responding to these higher prices the moment the buyers start to respond to the higher prices that's usually a signal that we're about to see a continuation and extension.

Quite a lot of absorption taking place in front of the imbalance.

Okay, so we can see now The market continues the process of moving higher and higher. I'm just going to keep fast forwarding this. Do note obviously the delta on the day, the cumulative delta on the day 2000. Also notice the relative volume quite high. These are also five minute rotations. So note we are forming a process of one time framing i.e. this candle, the next candle fails to take out the previous candle's low and so forth and so forth. Okay let's look now let's play this initiative out so we can see what that first pullback looks Remember, the market will continue to go until it finds the liquidity or the response of selling and then it will back off. Now, notice the imbalance at the high. Like I said to you, a market that's exhausting itself will begin the process of showing imbalances at the high. Potential opportunity for an exhaustive high why notice what we're seeing now. Okay, we're starting to see divergence Yeah, so we're starting to see the process of more selling at the extreme versus buying ie delta Divergence okay, so the market does back off.

We can see obviously the market just kept rotating higher and higher in a manner of one time framing. Now the reason I want to show you this example You know we may, I'm just going to reverse this a little bit, we may look at this first rotation and think that is the rotation, that is the beginning process of a pullback. Now what I will say is a rule of thumb in an initiative drive, the pullback should be at least a couple of minutes or rotations, why? Because by the definition, when there's initiation, the market is trying to find some sort of someone is responding to higher prices i.e. a seller we should see it continue for some time okay not just one rotation all right and that's the real clue obviously this did continue to extend in a one time framing manner and ultimately eventually it did pull back and give us the opportunity to enter long Okay, that's then the initiative drive Obviously now go and practice that in the slides ahead We're gonna go through that template together and then make sure you practice practice practice because that's what's gonna develop your real edges", "transcript": "to where that absorption steps in. That for me is the most important. When the market pulls back, that point where the absorption takes place, that's the real reference point I'm interested in. Now again notice how this example it pulled back to that last real bout of you know sort of buying absorption we saw and very quickly navigated higher. So a really really tricky one to get on to. We can see obviously the market just kept rotating higher and higher in a manner of one time framing.

It will look quite aggressive if we see this at the beginning of a session versus later on we can have higher liquidity as there's more strategies in the market and ultimately more liquidity available. In terms of volatility, higher with the open drive versus mid-session simply because of that lack of liquidity and overall price expansion with both variations.

Do note, obviously, this is a very aggressive type of interaction. You'll see even once we do find that liquidity, we do tend to see quite an aggressive interaction between both the buyers and the sellers. Now in terms of the metrics, volume will always be high in initiative drive. Why? Because initiative means new business, okay. As new business comes in and drives price higher, it brings in more participants, which means even more okay in terms of time that's a very key proponent like I mentioned earlier cash open we're going to see a different initiative drive to potentially mid-range initiative or mid-session initiative drives in terms of the delta it should consistently build with the obviously the initiative we want to see it build in the direction of initiative as well and also the cumulative delta should accumulate in the direction in which initiative is being taken in terms of the rate of changes and then consistent you know whilst it's initiating.

Okay let's now go So execution is relatively straightforward for the initiative drive, ultimately it's quite a passive entry and we can be quite aggressive on this. The wonderful thing about initiative drive is that we know there's a high probability for not just a retest of the extreme but also an extension. Now note risk is very simple, once we find that absorption, that first bit of absorption, we ultimately place our stop in and below that. potential target, you will have an idea for a potential target. So don't be afraid to have a slightly wider stop when there is that initiative.

See what you can get out of this book, it's a really, really good book. Note, obviously a summary, it's a modern day view of an approach to viewing the market, so you'll note she takes a very structured approach to the markets and that's You know, you're gonna want to adopt a very simplified rule-based approach and again, that's something you know We've we've tried to implement our way where we're not preempting The market we're not trying to be too subjective and opinionated rather We have an understanding of various strategies when the market shows the information We merely execute one of the ten strategies based on the fact-based information Key highlights, Volume Trainer has become a key proponent in financial markets in recent years. Okay, this was obviously written at a time when volume was becoming more and more focused on, obviously now everyone focuses on volume, but back then when she wrote it, it was still a relatively new concept. Ultimately, why volume and price response is so important and relevant, how to create and adopt a rules-based approach, I really like that section, and ultimately a simple yet effective approach to understanding underlying principle behind volume and that's the real crux of it. You really want to understand what volume signifies in your market, what it means in terms of observation, what it means in terms of interaction. this footprint tool course is all about interaction and volume shows us that very interaction. Let's now move on to the drill section and wrap up the unit. So you know the drill, you simply want to watch the drill, complete your own template, then watch the drill with the guided tuition, make some notes, adjust, move on to some of the videos we did within the unit, view those again, again complete the template as best you can. And when you're confident, you then consider moving on to the next unit. Obviously you do have a day off tomorrow so again if you need to catch up, if you want to revisit some of the slides, don't be afraid to do that and this is time for you to catch up and really ensure you understand the trade strategy. To finish patience is not how long you can wait but it's what you do whilst waiting and this You know, most people seem to think, oh, I'm patient. I don't mind waiting. OK, but not many people can keep a still mind, a still thought, you know, inactive whilst being patient. And that's the real art to being patient. OK, it's how you behave whilst being patient that ultimately dictates whether or not you have actually adopted a skill of patience or not. Thank you.
