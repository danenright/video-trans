Now as you can see, we started off with the all the way towards the high of the session. We're now trading 54.50s having started at 54.22s. Let's now go and have a look how this momentum is created. But more importantly, remember what we said. to ensure that we sell when sellers step in. We don't want to be selling now, why? Because there are still buyers in the market. We need to remain objective and honest. We sell when a seller steps in, not sell while someone is still buying the market. So let's see if we can capture that point where the actual seller steps in. Note, buyers still buying three and lifting four. Again, the buyer happy to take the four and happy to get sold something at four, and he keeps buying and buying and buying, looking to constantly fill out his buy order. Note, when the buyer doesn't get what he wants at the threes, what does he do? He goes to the fours, so the seller sells to him, but equally the buyer buys from the seller. Again, we can see, based on the price ladder, that the buyer is still in control No, technically we are approaching that 54, 52, 51 area. Again, we saw the buyer reloading the 2s, lifting the 3s. He's now reloading the 3s, lifting the 4s. He's now reloading the 4s and he's likely to lift the 5s. So we're still seeing relative strength being shown by the buyer in this example.

And again, the market is lifting the fours. Let's see what happens now as this buyer gets filled. is the buyer actually got filled. If we look in that right side, we can see the buyer really wanted those 42s. He took all 100 contracts at the 42 area. Very important guys, because if there is a buyer taking this much volume around the high of the day, again it's telling us that the buyer someone sold it to him and the mere fact that someone sold a hundred contracts at the high of the day is telling us that the sellers are actually not weak and they are taking advantage of the higher prices being advertised. Let's see now if we can capture where the sudden momentum shift occurs. Remember, we've now seen buyers in control holding the bid, moving the market up from 54.21 up towards 54.46. We had two key price ladder hints coming at us. We saw a 120 lot lower down, which didn't trade and the market very quickly moved away from it. We then saw another 100 lot come onto the bid at 42s, but this time around someone actually sold it to him and we didn't see the aggressive nature as we saw previously. So we've had a sudden shift in what we saw down at 54.21s and 54.42s. Two very different auction processes have occurred between buyers and sellers. The latter, or the charts, won't always show this very forward-looking information, and this is why we utilize the combination of the two trading tools. Now, the market has come in and retested the previous high of the session. Let's take note of what occurs now. The market's trading 45. But, equally, the buyer is happy to keep reloading the 45s and trade the 46s. Okay, we rejoin this price action now, and we can see how suddenly the markets come.

Prices had reached a premium and suddenly we've moved very quickly lower ever since I hope you can see the difference just in this basic example of how we've had three different types of price responses between buyers and sellers. Firstly, we had a buyer panicking, looking to be more aggressive. Then we saw a lot of two-way trade response between buyers and sellers as we moved towards the previous high of the day. And thirdly, we saw once the market advertised premium prices, a seller stepped in very aggressively. Now, the execution is simple. We've seen the sudden shift in momentum. We are now looking to execute aggressively where a seller allows us to get involved. As you can see here, bang, the market has briefly paused, it's taken a little bit of a bid up. We are now looking to execute our trade strategy with a stop above the high. So we enter the 39s and the 40s, we put a stop at the 52s and we're looking to target all the way down to the 64s. Notice how we've used the combination of the price ladder and the various strategies Also, notice how we've taken a strategy that we've developed over time and incorporated it and utilized the two different skill sets together. Now important to understand, it takes time to develop strategies, you know, technical strategies using the volume profile, but equally, it takes a lot of time to also develop various price ladder skills. Let's now fast forward this and see what occurs as we move the price forward. the market continues to move lower and lower and lower and lower and lower and lower as the seller has now taken full control of this auction process. Let's now wrap up and summarise. In summary, it's imperative to not only have volume profiling strategies but equally What occurred in this example over time, is that the market eventually filtered all the way down and retested and gave us our exit.", "transcript": "Okay, we rejoin this price action now, and we can see how suddenly the markets come. It's retested that high We've seen a little bit of momentum coming into this high and all of a sudden the seller has started to go firm on his offerings Equally the seller is now not just firm on his offer He's hitting the buyer and hitting the buyer hitting the buyer hitting the buyer hitting the buyer hitting the buyer constantly becoming aggressive so As you would have noticed, we had that slow grind around the highs, suddenly we retested the previous high and the seller became aggressive. Prices had reached a premium and suddenly we've moved very quickly lower ever since I hope you can see the difference just in this basic example of how we've had three different types of price responses between buyers and sellers. Firstly, we had a buyer panicking, looking to be more aggressive. Then we saw a lot of two-way trade response between buyers and sellers as we moved towards the previous high of the day. And thirdly, we saw once the market advertised premium prices, a seller stepped in very aggressively. Now, the execution is simple. We've seen the sudden shift in momentum.

More importantly is that if you go look at a chart from this date you will find that actually this was the high in the oil for not just this day but also for a couple of days. So almost two weeks this high held. Now what is important to note is that whilst we you know didn't necessarily hold on to this trade for that length of time, we did utilize our strategy and executed accordingly to what the price ladder was showing us. This then wraps up our example of how we use the price ladder and the volume profiling in combination.
