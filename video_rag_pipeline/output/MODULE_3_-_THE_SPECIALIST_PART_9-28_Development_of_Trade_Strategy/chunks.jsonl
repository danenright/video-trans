Ultimately, what you want to think about here is how much of your day do you want to risk on this strategy? What sort of size do you want to put onto the strategy? How are you going to manage when you go on-side or off-side? Are you going to pyramid? Are you willing to average? These are all sorts of considerations you need to take into account when determining your risk management and money management style. Now again, different setups, different strategies will have completely different risk parameters. If you're doing a momentum trade setup, the risk is far tighter. If you're doing, say, a high volume area setup, remember we spoke about a lot of two-way it's important to make sure you understand the risk profile for each individual strategy. Once you've done that we then move on to the execution methodology. Now this is one of the most crucial parts because every single price, every single increment in the market is effectively money gained or lost. So the question you need to be asking yourself is how do you enter? Are you aggressive like in the low-volume area? Okay, are you entering with limit orders or are you entering with stop orders? Then stop placement, where in the strategy, in other words, the stop placement is very simple. I get this question very often where people ask, you know, where do you stop at for a certain number of prices. It's very simple and listen to me carefully. you stop out where the trade strategy is invalidated, in other words, it's no longer validated by what you initially got into the trade for. So in simple terms, again, with the breakout trade setup that we spoke about, if you're expecting an aggressive move up and you're not expecting to go very far offside because you are going with momentum, the minute you do go offside, or the minute you do That is the point at which you exit, not the point of a predetermined stop, not this business of a trailing stop. You exit where the trade strategy is no longer valid, and that is what a stop is. It's the point that stops you out of a trade that is no longer valid. There is no hard fast rule when it comes to stop placement. The hard fast rule is very simply, you get out when the trade is invalid. where look at where you want to target notes where are you getting out of the trade and taking profit again there's no hard fast rule there's no risk reward of two to one three to one four to one that's what the textbooks teach you", "transcript": "Now, once you have completed that, we then move on to the risk management and money management side of things.

The minute we see responsive selling into the market, that's the point at which we exit. That's the point at which we take our profits. Why? Because we can see sellers, other time frame or other participants stepping into the market taking the opposite side trade. That is the point at which we need to get out of our breakout setup. we get out when the market tells us to get out. Now, once you've done the execution methodology, we then move on to expectation analysis and emotional tracking. So crucial, another important section which I'm not sure many of you have thought about before. So, what is this? Well, simply, what do you expect to see? What's the kind of interaction, the We spoke a little bit about time in module 2. We spoke about how crucial time is at measuring the success of a trade. Remember, if you're trading a momentum type play, the time expected to see success is far slower than, for instance, if you're trading, say, a bracketing high volume area trade. This is crucial to understanding because when you have an expectation analysis, when the market does what you don't expect it to do, That's a very, very early clue that something is actually not quite like you thought it might have been. That is the time you want to exit. That is the time you want to reduce risk. When there's uncertainty or a lower probability of success, that's where you exit. You enter because there's a high probability of an event occurring and you exit because the probability of success is diminishing. Not many traders think about this in terms of their emotional tracking. So what do I mean by this? Certain traders are very good at sitting off-site. Certain traders are very good at taking risk. Certain traders don't mind going a long way off-site. But then there's certain traders that hate taking risk. And that's okay, guys.

At the end of the day, you need to go over that strategy. You need to go look point for point how that strategy played out. You need to annotate it. You need to look how the buyers and sellers interacted. You need to find any sort of observation that was either as you expected or not as you expected.
