So, what we're going to do as usual is we're going to go through a few things to point out before we actually do spend some time with the replay function. Now, the important thing to understand with the consolidation breakout is, first and foremost, a momentum strategy. you would get various types of consolidation. An important thing to understand is that consolidation is merely the market biding its time or a lot of two-way trade that the market is executing before the next move. So we're waiting for that next trigger, whether that's technical in nature and we see initiative being taken by either the buyers or sellers, or whether that is just more fundamental information that the buyers and sellers can then interact off. Now, some of the types of consolidation areas we've spoken about in previous slides would be as follows. So the first would be when we have a market that is what we would say coiling. So we would get sort of a daily distribution like that and then a second day like that and a third day like that where we get constant overlap between not just where the market perceives fair value to be, but where the market, in terms of trading price, we get overlap, and we're trading within each day's range, day after day after day. So that would be the first type of consolidation we could get. And we saw this example, as we spoke about previously, we saw this example in the oil Not too long ago now the second type of consolidation Which is also known as the inside day or is you know where we have just merely you know That would be our day one and our day two would then be inside the previous day now again This is also a form of consolidation It's not as powerful as the first example simply because you know there's not that much energy That's been coiled up as in the example the first example, but it is still a very important up and consolidation pattern as it does bring pretty good opportunities. And then the third type of consolidation is where we have a lot of overlapping trade in and around a key support area. Now note this doesn't have to necessarily be inside candles or within the previous day's range but we do need to see a lot of consolidation either around key resistance or some longer run areas that the market's paying attention to. So those are the three types of consolidation that we spoke about. Now, the important thing to understand is that when we have this consolidation we then need to be prepping ourselves for the breakout.

Now, A breakout in essence is it's a very patient trade setup and timing is absolutely crucial to the breakout. Some of the key characteristics to pay attention when we go through this example are the things like for instance volume, the volatility, the momentum, so we're just going to write So those are some of the key things you want to pay attention to as we go through the example ahead. So let's click the play button and see what happens. Now the first thing to point out is the context of the previous day. Now the context of what we were seeing in this market would be we've effectively had Day two we had a higher low with a nice buying tail, so a very key little low there. And day three suddenly we've opened up in and around this point. Now what we're looking for is we're looking for a break of this one, this tail buying day but then also to the lower bound of the day one. So we've got a day one there, day two, and we're currently sitting on day three. The important levels to watch out for the permanent areas is this 21.15. This area is that first tail that we had on day two, and then this loya from day one So that's the areas we're going to pay attention to as we go through the setup. Now remember, I said to you the key to this momentum play is not necessary to identify that we could see a break, okay? Any trader, anyone that looks at charts will be able to tell you that a break is coming or that a market is about to move up or down. The trick and the art to this trade strategy is to perfect the timing and that's what I'm going to show you today I'm going to show you how one we've identified the characteristics now We've said this is what we're looking for to get involved in this trade But two we're looking for a very specific form of execution and that execution is going to come Very aggressive. Okay note. It is a momentum play. So we have to be aggressive in entry and to we need to be looking for speed and volatility. So that's the key execution parameters we're looking for as we go through this trade setup. So again, as you can see now, we're very easily sitting well within the previous day's range, and let's just fast-forward this a little bit further on and get a little bit closer to those key areas of reference.

Now the important thing with these momentum plays, is to understand that when a market approaches these key levels, how it responds at those levels is crucial. We don't particularly want to see the ... the market spending too much time around this area. Let's watch what the market does in and around that first little tail area. We can see, note how the R prints, we've seen a little bit of volatility in that R print, we've seen a much bigger range than other prints, and again, notice what the market does there first time. Market bounces off the 2116s, showing a little bit of respect. As you can see straight away we've got a pick-up in volatility on the R print, market opens up a little bit. Okay, again continues the volatility toward the downside, again we can see the volume picking up in this situation, but note how the market respects that 21.16 first time. It says the sellers step into that area, they're not ready to commit to the break just yet. Now that's important to understand because preempting breakouts can be very, very costly. Yes, we want to be aggressive, but we do not want to be aggressive until the market has made the break. That's important to understand. Once it makes the break, once we get confirmation on this T-print that we close below the 2016s, bang, then we get aggressive to the short side because now the market is confirming that we have actually broken. Let's play on now and see what happens for the rest of the setup. Again, second attempt at it, market comes in and finally we get the hold below the 2016. Now what we're looking for, now that we've broken below, the very next TPO, so the very next TPO which is our, let's just rub that out, which is our U-print, that is our entry print. a retest. So it's giving us the opportunity for short side entry trades. Again, note the trade being facilitated lower bound before we then get the continuation. Now, one of the pitfalls, one of the mistakes a lot of traders make is that because they've seen the break, they get very aggressive on the short and they start selling in and around this area at the lower year.

We've also now taken out that second level, 21.12s, and again, look at the continuation. A nice 6, 7, 8 handle move to the downside. In terms of the close profile, let's just take a look at some of the key identifiers that we can pay attention to. So that was our key area, the 21.16, and we spoke about the 21.12s. Now notice how once the marker took out that first area and confirmed the break, We then got the market suddenly starting to leave single prints and single prints and a low volume traded area and a continuation. So again, the key to managing this setup is to be aggressive, but be aggressive at the right time when the market suggests you be aggressive. Again, that's pretty much the highlight of a consolidation breakout play. It pretty much highlights where you want to be aggressive, how you want to be aggressive, and most importantly, how you want to execute and manage the trade. In terms of targets, remember, sometimes you're not going to get such a straightforward continuation patterns. Sometimes you're going to get a lot of two-way trade, and you're not going to get all these various areas of single prints. If the market is showing signs of initiative, showing signs of aggressiveness, then don't get out of the trade. Don't forget, we get out of a trade when the market tells us to get out of the trade, not when we feel we should get out of the trade. That example comes here. There's your example. Buyers have stepped in now on this apron. We can see that buyers are in. So if we short from somewhere higher up here, we're now looking to take profit as buyers have stepped in to the market. And we can see the confirmation as buyers stepping in, as notice how all of a sudden, ever since you made that apron, the market is now consolidating in the lower bound of the range. So that is pretty much our consolidation breakout. Going forward in terms of setup, don't forget the key strategies, okay? When obviously we're looking for a break of 16s, we're looking for a break of 12s, waiting for that confirmation. But don't forget, the first time we test that 20-12s, you want to be looking for first time shorts. Why?
