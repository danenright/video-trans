Remember, this is the area where little trade is being facilitated, whether that's through volume or over time. Now the principles of low volume area, and we dealt with this quite extensively in Module 2, but the principles are that they show us directional conviction. Remember we spoke about control identifiers in Module 2. So the low volume area shows us a little It also shows us unbalanced or imbalanced trending markets. So again, when you see these low volume areas, you're seeing a little bit of initiative, you're seeing a little bit of directional bias in the market. And the question you have to ask yourself is, will this directional bias hold or not? gaps and single TPO's or time price observations or tails in the market, volume tails or even excess tails. So again, these are all sorts of the types of low volume areas that you can expect to see in the volume profile. Now, some of the observations with regards to low volume areas is that once a low volume area begins to be filled, the sentiment and the conviction is gone, so the initiative is gone, the initial move that we've seen, the momentum and the conviction is starting to disappear, and that means it's time to exit that convictional play. Now, note, should trade substantially trade through the low volume area, we could see a bit of a squeeze. In other words, anyone that was playing with the convictional direction should start to exit those trades. So again, don't be the last one out. When that conviction is gone, when that momentum is gone and we no longer have that be the first one out. And then lastly, low-volume areas tend to become high-volume areas over time as the market begins to accept the area. So again, if you play for the high-volume area, the directional trend momentum play, that's brilliant, but don't forget, once that play disappears, once the low-volume area begins to fill out, we should see quite a lot of two-way trade. So again, once we start to fill out low volume errors, you can expect to see a lot of two-way trade and this is where you want to employ your distribution type strategies.", "transcript": "Let's now look at the low volume area.
