And once you identify the iceberg, you really start maneuvering around it. So you observe the iceberg, then you start working yourself with the iceberg and you start scalping around that iceberg. We'll be looking at these plays in a couple of video tutorials and a couple of strategies that will really be showing you how to effectively Now the holding period of the trade is determinant on the auctioning velocity in the context of the market positioning So if the market is moving very quickly in a you know In a short period of time and then all of a sudden just hits an iceberg And you observe that iceberg in a very intraday timeframe perspective You might just go for a couple of ticks in a couple of seconds Whereas if the market is moving near a critical level that you've observed and it's iceberging it over a period of you know, over a period of hours, well then you may be scalping in and around that iceberg but also building a key, a key core position that you might hold for the next couple of hours because you, because your level that you observe in the chart is being confirmed by price action. Now remember, it's one of the things I always say to the younger traders I train for, it's always easy to spot a level, but the difficult part on the skill is how you trade the level. price action events that you're observing. So really important, it's the context of the market positioning, where it's located will determine how you maneuver around the iceberg. And we look at that in a couple of videos. anything that's beyond the average activity, you know, what we call anomaly auctioning events. So what I mean by that is, you know, the market is moving at one type of speed and momentum until it hits a price area that changes the way the orders are going through the order book and the market is not advancing declining in such a way, well then that starts becoming an anomaly from the recent activity or the time frame that you're observing. So it's an anomaly auction events and that's what you're trying to observe when we when we when we look at all the videos and different training strategies and the tutorials on how to observe this. The faster the pace of the market, so remember this, this is why great volume and great activity and we look at this in our video tutorials, the faster the pace of the market relative to its average pace and intensity of the exchange, so intensity of the exchange between the orders and the order sitting on the on the bit of the It's really difficult to see when there's nothing going through the market to see well Is there an iceberg or not?
