I look at the major benefits of price ladder information gathering and execution versus exclusive charts Now instead of a one-dimensional size approach for Pacific chart levels can manage your size more effectively Enlighten a position when a trade is not showing strong order flow characteristics, and we briefly dipped in this on the previous slide The best traders know when to have the most of their size in the market and when to have as little as possible in the market and to make that judgment rarely is dependent on the sheer activity or lack of activity that is going on the price ladder. So if you are going towards a breakout trade and I've used this example over and over again and if you are looking for that breakout but that breakout is not being met, you know, you go inside a couple of ticks but the activity is not how it should be if the market wants to continue in a direction and the velocity in the auctioning exchange which we discuss later on and we'll just start discussing speed but you'll start gathering I really start meaning when I start saying how quickly the orders are going through on the book and it's so important to understand that when there is no activity, but perhaps you're observing a certain type of algorithm in the market or a flipper and you can observe a very concrete pattern and you can see the balance of probabilities of what the algorithm is doing as long as the algorithm is there, well then you can execute with a really aggressive size because you're trading in with a larger participant potentially or as I said, with a large breakout strategy If the orders aren't going through, then you're going to reduce your risk. If the orders are going through, you're going to maximise your risk. You can't do that on a chart because the chart is one-dimensional. You don't see how fast or slow it's going. You just see time. That's effective. All you see is time versus price. You're not seeing time, price and order flow activity. It's almost a three-dimensional approach when you're trading on the price ladder. It's a really important consideration and really important understanding one of the how important the price that is to managing size. And as I've just mentioned you can rapidly increase slides when the order flow activity picks up towards a critical juncture point. So prior to a breakout point the market always gives you a subtle clue with the orders that go through the market. You know as it approaches the level it starts it starts behaving differently and it's your ability to observe that behavioral change will then determine the outcome of the myriad of patterns within a chart as exposed to the exciting world of volume", "transcript": "Okay, let's go into this even a little bit more further.
