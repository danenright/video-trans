So as you get to know your market intimately, you start understanding what high speed is and what low speed is. And what's happening is that as the market has really been trading in this area, we're really trading in a very lethargic type of manner. And as the market has kind of traded up and it's lost any type of speed, well, you can see in this instance that the trader is now actually short here, 10 lots at the 65s, looking for a potential move to the downside because it feels that, well, if it were to be a momentum play and the market were to really start moving aggressively to the upside, you want to start seeing the speed of how many lots can you trade per 10 seconds or per 30 seconds, really increase or pick up in activity. if the speed and activity starts picking up as the market progresses towards the upside well then he'll potentially have to start covering the trade and so now let's look now what I'm going I'm actually, now you're watching, you've been watching this very closely, okay? You've been watching the speed by the volume profile and how many orders are going through the order book. Now, if we start speeding this up, you'll really start to notice, if you start speeding this up, let's speed this up a little bit for you. And this is how the market can move at a particular point in time. So, if all of a sudden, The market activity, now if you see over here, now I've actually just speeded this up four times, but what I'm trying to illustrate to you, the market can pick up its speed quite phenomenally. Now you can see that all of a sudden the speed per lots being traded is a lot quicker. So let's ignore time, because time is four times quicker now. But assume this was normal trading activity and whatever we saw over there, that speed, the moment the speed changes, it's personality so it shifts the gear it shifts from first gear to fourth gear all of a sudden you start paying very close attention because when you start paying that very close attention you can start actually seeing the underlying dynamic that's going in the market and you can start seeing potential absorption which we look at later on in the modules or particular types of activity coming from the other time frame participants so all of a sudden the speed is starting to increase and so if you watch the market shift from first to fourth gear that's towards a key potential technical breakout level, well the likelihood of a breakout towards the upside starts increasing at a rather rapid rate. So if the speed picks up, so if the market moves from a lethargic area and it goes up high and all of a sudden the speed starts increasing, well then the likelihood. the probability of a breakout starts increasing rapidly.

So what I'm going to show you over here is we're going to look this down Now, we've just covered speed and what I mean by speed. Remember, the higher the speed as we look through the rest of this module, the higher the speed, especially on momentum plays as the market approaches key areas and the speed starts picking up, then the greater the chance of the market breaching technical boundaries provided that once it's breaching those boundaries, the market is continuing in that direction and the speed doesn't become lethargic but instead starts picking itself up. So we've just looked at speed. Auctioning activity the level of auctioning activities what I mean by the level of auctioning activity now if you have good speed going through the market Which so lots of lots being traded, but if the market is auctioning on both sides So all of a sudden there's a seller So so the seller sells 300 lots and then the buyer buys 300 lots and the seller buys three and lots and then it Moves to the next price and the same process evolves as opposed to say so that's good auction activity is that there's two-way exchange but say at the market all of a sudden so we're looking at this so say say all of a sudden the market goes to 67 takes a hundred hundred and 240 lots out let's actually just freeze this for a moment so we can look at this order book so say all of a sudden We are trading here now. There's a hundred thirty three lots all of a sudden someone buys a hundred thirty three lots Then no one sells it then the next buyer so the markets trading bid to sixty sevens the next Buyer comes in he buys 476 lots of trades and no one sells into that bid then the next buyer buys 540 lots and it keeps on going up So what's happening now is that the market is going up, but it's not going up with any auctioning activity A lot of times when it goes up with no auctioning activity, the likelihood of a reversal becomes quite great because it wasn't built on a strong foundation. A strong foundation for prices to keep on advancing is if the market exchanges both sides. So as long as there is a marketplace and there's auctioning, the market will keep on bidding and sustaining its bid, provided there's auctioning on both sides. then there's a 200 lot sitting, but then all of a sudden someone sells into a 200 lot, and then there's 300 lots sitting over there, and then someone buys 300.

So understanding these little subtle shifts in the price ladder really stands you in good stead to understanding if a market can continue in this direction or if the market cannot. But when you have good speed and good auction activity, the likelihood, as we look later on in one of the modules, the likelihood of good momentum plays and trades happening. So you really want good auctioning activity and this is how we set out all our price ladder analysis and later on when we look at a whole host of different videos and looking at the really the market velocity to determine the degree or the lack of degree of success of the trade idea. So this is a really critically important. So we've looked at this speed and auction activity. Now let's now have a look at the relative speed of the over here is say for example on the day okay so what I'm gonna do over here say on the day that well what's what starts happening is that the markets on the one side say this is the high of the day okay so let's draw this say 67s is the high of the day and in this area yes you know at 67s the speed that's going through a slow is tired, is lethargic. What do I mean by slow tile lethargic? I mean that the speed is low, so only 10 lots being traded per 10 seconds. The auction activity is non-existent. You know, there's hardly anything going through, there's hardly any orders going through on the ladder. No one's really exchanging on both sides. And we observe that. And all of a sudden the market says, you know what, I'm not finding any auctioning, any auctioning activity. I'm not finding any interest. Then all of a sudden the market starts slowly then drifting downwards as the market looks, the market is always in a state of diseal equilibrium looking for an area of interest. So after the market auctions up and it finds no activity then the market starts auctioning down to look for a new party and it wants to go find that party where there's lots of people at it. So all of a sudden an auction is done and all of a sudden the speed starts picking up. I want to actually fast forward, so what was actually happening on the day in this video is that you can see, if you look over here, the auctioning, 40 lots has traded here now. Now look, one, two, three, one lot in the last three seconds, one, two, three, another two lot. Okay, 25 lots, but really slow. Now let's, now I really want you to cement what I've just showed you here.", "transcript": "then there's a 200 lot sitting, but then all of a sudden someone sells into a 200 lot, and then there's 300 lots sitting over there, and then someone buys 300.

Now let's, now I really want you to cement what I've just showed you here. of how slow the activity is. Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to bring this video a little bit forward. So what I'm saying is you've noticed the relative speed of the date. So the relative speed at this moment and at this part of the range is really low. So if I now go and move this, if I now go and move this a little bit further so this person still holds on to the shorts. If I go now and move this. Okay, the person Okay, so now the markets going towards the low side of this range, so now what I want you to observe here is now let's watch, so you watch the speed of how quick it was going up there, now look over here, ready, the orders are going through a little bit quicker already, and as we watch this, you know, I really want you to really start, you You know, at the moment, the market is trading towards the low extreme of the current day's range. And if I just fast forward a little bit more, okay, now you can see that the market is approaching the low of the day, and then the orders are starting to go through. The speed isn't that intense at the moment, it was a little bit more intense over there. And we just start, we just start watching this market, we just start watching this market trade. And all of a sudden, you're starting to see, okay, one lot has hit the, you know, has hit the 54s. We have another one lot above there, and we're still seeing nothing really that's bringing much interest. The reason why this person, or the reason why there was a short over here because thought that the market lost its interest up here, so finding a short towards the lowest side of the range.

You want to see the speed start picking up to relative to where it was up there So all of a sudden you're seeing you know, you're seeing a little bit more activity There's a little bit more interest going on down here and really when you see it observable interest You know, it's not quite observable yet to you know The untrade I but all of a sudden the speed of this area is starting to pick up, and there's auctioning that's happening on both sides, so they're offering and then they're rebidding, they're offering and then they're rebidding, and there's trading", "transcript": "is that you can see, if you look over here, the auctioning, 40 lots has traded here now.

So that's what I mean Of the day is so you're looking at well What did it do up there and what is it doing down here if the speed of the air is high in that speed? The the the likelihood of a progress towards at the downside is greater Versus the upside because it's showing you a different area of exchange and you can see the orders that are going through a lot More aggressive, you know because we knew that down there the orders were so now look how quickly this is starting to go through We've actually we're going through very aggressively. The orders are going through a lot more aggressively and because Suppose you know how the market traded on that side, you have more conviction being short on this side. So really critically important to really understand market velocity because it helps you really structure your trades more effectively. And just the last point is the relative price zone. It's the same as the relative speed of the day. The relative price zone will, if you know that the market... was trading over here in a price zone between 63 and 68 and in that price zone It was trading at, you know, really slow Natharja, but also in this price zone. There's a lot more trading activity There's there's a lot more trading activity over here. So just sorry There's a lot more trading activity here. Then all of a sudden you're gonna be happy being short on this side You're gonna you're gonna be happy until The relative price speed starts slowing down and when it starts slowing down you start booking your profits potentially this person's now I eventually booked his profit down there But as well, you know one of the traders who was looking for this trade But really important to understand market velocity. So effectively again just to summarize you're looking at the speed of the exchange the level of auction between the buy and the sell side. You want to always know the relative speed of the day because each day is unique or each week is unique. You know, the relative speed of the highs versus the lows. So when the market turns over, you can be convicted on the one side. So all very important considerations when you are looking at market velocity. And to me, this is one of the most important things. This is the foundation. Once you just understand your market velocity and you're able to seize up it helps your ability to determine absorption plays,", "transcript": "You know, it's not quite observable yet to you know The untrade I but all of a sudden the speed of this area is starting to pick up, and there's auctioning that's happening on both sides, so they're offering and then they're rebidding, they're offering and then they're rebidding, and there's trading going on, there's 500 lots that has been traded over here at the moment, and all of a sudden there's an extra 100 lots, and as the speed starts picking up... you really want to start seeing, you know, and in an ideal scenario what I'm actually going to do now is just, you know, just forward this a little bit quicker, is if all of a sudden you start seeing the speed pick up a lot more, so you see the one lot, the 11 lots, and you'll notice this, you know, that's not, you know, in this example you start seeing the exchange really, really going through on the market, and when you start watching this, the level of the progress of the move towards the downside starts becoming greater. So that's what I mean Of the day is so you're looking at well What did it do up there and what is it doing down here if the speed of the air is high in that speed? The the the likelihood of a progress towards at the downside is greater Versus the upside because it's showing you a different area of exchange and you can see the orders that are going through a lot More aggressive, you know because we knew that down there the orders were so now look how quickly this is starting to go through We've actually we're going through very aggressively. The orders are going through a lot more aggressively and because Suppose you know how the market traded on that side, you have more conviction being short on this side. So really critically important to really understand market velocity because it helps you really structure your trades more effectively. And just the last point is the relative price zone. It's the same as the relative speed of the day. The relative price zone will, if you know that the market... was trading over here in a price zone between 63 and 68 and in that price zone It was trading at, you know, really slow Natharja, but also in this price zone. There's a lot more trading activity There's there's a lot more trading activity over here. So just sorry There's a lot more trading activity here. Then all of a sudden you're gonna be happy being short on this side You're gonna you're gonna be happy until The relative price speed starts slowing down and when it starts slowing down you start booking your profits potentially this person's now I eventually booked his profit down there But as well, you know one of the traders who was looking for this trade But really important to understand market velocity.
