We notice a very Different volume landscape where we're seeing a lot of initiative activity Towards a key level that we've identified and what we're looking at as we approach that key level that we have identified How we how aggressive is the momentum how aggressive there's a speed how aggressive are the orders going through the market? How aggressive is the market actually auctioning the price as a once as it starts engaging a new price discovery mode?
