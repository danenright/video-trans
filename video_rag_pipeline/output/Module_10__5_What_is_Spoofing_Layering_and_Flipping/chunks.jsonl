So there's three links there, so click on all of them. go through each one of the links read in detail until you understand it so you really understand also the illegal aspect of it and and and and look at one of the the predominant um known flippers Back in the early 2000s, around the 2004 to 2007 era, Paul Rotter explains his strategy a little bit so you really understand what it is.

So you you're putting these orders on the order book whether on the buy side or the sell side and you you're either putting one or two orders or you're layering the entire order book and the layering is where you put more than more than one order on the order book and you don't you you try to artificially create strong demand or strong supply without the investor demand in the market, thereby changing the behaviour of other traders and allowing the spoofer to profit from these changes.

So they're looking, they're trying to artificially make the sell side look strong filled and the moment they get the buy orders filled they pull the sell or their sell orders the market flips up and then they get filled and we'll look at a couple of videos where you see this type of activity and this type of action and just ensure when you are developing as a trader if you become a very large price ladder trader that you're very aware of these of these rules and laws because you do not want to be prosecuted so please read these articles Please make sure that you don't engage", "transcript": "Okay, so what is spoofing, layering, and flipping?
