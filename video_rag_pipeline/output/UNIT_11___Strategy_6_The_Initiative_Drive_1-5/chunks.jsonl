This is challenge day 19 of 30. In the following slide we're going to focus on the art of deliberate practice. Why practice is imperative to high performance and how you can practice as a trader. What we're going to talk about today is this idea of deliberate practice and I'm going to go through what deliberate means and then I'm going to give you a few ideas of how you can be more deliberate in your practice. So the first thing, the definition of deliberate is it's done conscientiously and intentionally. Okay, now just some way to write down on a piece of paper, conscientiously and Ask yourself as you go through the week. Ask yourself when you look at something when you observe the markets when you Preparing for your day when you you're recording your trades setups. Are you doing this? Conscientiously and intentionally with purpose now, I think what a lot of you are gonna find is actually you don't do it Okay, what you're going to find is that a lot of you do it more as, you know, you feel like you have to just fix up your charts and, you know, then put in a line or two here and, you know, then you feel like, well, you know, I've done a bit of effort, I'm deserving of something. Now the second thing to do in terms of definition is to engage in long and careful Now, again, it brings you back to this idea, when a lot of people look at charts, they look at it in the sense of, well, the market came down, it hit the support, or it hit this moving average, or it hit this point, reference point, and then it bounced. But how many of you actually think about, firstly, what brought the market down to a point in the first place, and then what actually made it bounce? Now, a lot of you might think that prices going down reflect seller selling. Okay, prices can go down for a number of reasons. There could be hedging reasons, there could be spreading reasons, there could be, you know, long liquidation. There's a number of reasons why prices go down. So how many of you actually engage in long and careful consideration when viewing the Now the reason I want to talk about deliberate practice this week and the reason I've shown you that video is you know a lot Of us including myself we admire you know we admire the best golfers in the world and the best sportsmen in the world and we admire the skill and Talent that they have and we look at them and we envy them and we think well You know, I wish I could be that person. Why am I not that person? Well, I'll tell you why you're not that person because then today you do not deliberately practice every single day to become that little bit better", "transcript": "The footprint course unit 11, the initiative drive.

We only see the tip of the iceberg. We only see the end outcome We don't see the hours upon hours of of pain and suffering and purposeful practice that goes into it Now the picture I've shown you has a very simple Annotation of what professional golfers have to do now if you look at this picture You will find that sometimes a professional golfer has to stand over a three or a four or five foot putt for two hours he has to hit the same putt a hundred times over whether he likes it or not. Why? Because this deliberate practice is what will differentiate him from the winner and everyone else when it comes to that pressure putt. That is why they practice these things and that is why you need to be practicing them. So let's go over a few points. Firstly, it might be a bit cliche but practice does make perfect. If you practice the same same thing time and time and time again When it comes to actually delivering, you're going to execute far more better, and you're not going to execute better simply because you've practiced, you're going to execute better because there's a lot more trust in what you're doing. We deliberately practice because we want to develop real skill. Trading the markets day in and day out is not about finding those levels, clicking and then you make a bit of money and you move on, you come back the next day. That's not trading. Trading is about developing key skill sets, whether that's learning to manage prices, if that's becoming better at managing risk, if that's better at trading an array of markets, whether that's understanding the difference between algorithmic type trading or longer term swing trading, every one of these is a skill in its own. And in order to develop those skills you have to deliberately practice what is going We've already spoken about the tip for the iceberg don't forget the end outcome is just the tip You know you can marvel it at you know some traders You know I can look at traders around me and think oh wow these guys You know that they're making a hundred thousand pounds a day, and wow why am I not that person? Why can't I be as good as him, but in the day? I don't get to see what goes on you know behind the scenes I don't know what sort of pressure and you know sort of things he does on the weekend I don't know what sort of you know mental exercises this guy spending hours every single day doing but he's doing something. And that's the important thing. He's deliberately practicing something that makes him a little bit better. Then shortcuts. This is something that a lot of people are constantly looking for in this industry. Shortcuts. There is no such thing as a shortcut. I cannot teach any one of you to trade.

You're not doing the right thing It's a boring job, it's a process like any job.

Right you listening in on this periscope today guys already you are taking a step in the right direction Why well because I've probably got more experience while I'm ahead of most of you No, it's I've been through some of the pitfalls that some of you are going to go through So me guiding you me giving you a little heads up is oh, you know what? You're probably gonna blow out at some point. Yeah me giving you a heads up You're probably gonna average a bad trade sometime and have to learn a very very valuable lesson me giving you these heads ups It's going to speed your learning curve up and that's what's important and that's why you want to mental, then active.

Keep it smart. Analyze the market with a very specific intent. That way you're going to get very specific outcomes. Then, replay functionality.

Every one of the professional traders that I sit around, every one of the traders that I associate, I know they go at the end of the day and they go and look how they executed their trades. They go and look at the physical entry into the market of how they executed, how they managed to clip, how they got out of the target, how they took stops. They look at these things because it's all about the inches. If you can be better at the little inches, they're going to end up becoming yards one day. And that's why we focus on it.
