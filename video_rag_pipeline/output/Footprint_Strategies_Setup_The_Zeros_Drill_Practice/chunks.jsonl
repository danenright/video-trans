Now I'm just going to push pause here and go over one or two things that we can see at hand. So we can see the market's kind of gone into a little bit of a accumulation distribution phase ahead of the break. Now the key is within that accumulation and distribution phase is to be aware when that break could potentially come. Now The real, real standout factor, we obviously mentioned a number of factors that we can observe before the break, but in this example, the real standout factor is pretty much the sudden shift in the volume and volatility, so... In the previous rotation we can really see how the market came down, again it got rejected at these lower prices, we can see it came all the way down to the 78s, traded 46 contracts and went straight back up. But on the way down, note the dark blues, some real chunky absorption took place at these higher prices. Now yes, we can argue there was quite a bit of absorption in that previous rotation Hence, we should have been looking for longs in that previous rotation. That is fair enough. However, that being said, there's one key little subtle clue. When we have this absorption ahead of the break, we want to see that absorption as close to the extreme point as possible. That's the real key. Obviously, this absorption does signify that buyers are willing to be buying higher and the high.

There's a little bit of a change-up in how the buyers and sellers are ultimately interacting.

Okay, so that was the real subtle clue.

In essence, there was a subtle clue that something was brewing. volume rotation we've had in this example and it came just before the next rotation which is when we got that snap high.

Let's go and have a look at how we could have got in Okay, obviously, in terms of the breakout, we're looking for a pullback point. Like in the initiative drive, there's no exact pullback point, there's a number of things we can look at. Obviously, we can look for previous key absorption points, maybe around the 10s, 11s, or maybe even the 12s with some really good absorption there. We can look for a fill of maybe an imbalance, or we can look for maybe a key previous swing high or low. us an idea of where we can enter. In this example, again, notice the dark shading.
