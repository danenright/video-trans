One of the orders is a limit order away from the market, and the other order is a stop order. If one of the orders is filled, the other order is automatically canceled. Traders typically use the TTOCO to automate their exit strategy from an open position. The limit order is used to realize a profit at a predetermined level, and the stop order is used to limit the loss on the downside. Let's use MDTrader to enter a TTOCO to close our position. From MDTrader, we select TTOCO from our order type drop-down menu. We are going to use a stop limit order for our stop and set pay up ticks to zero. With our parameters set, we need to select the price levels where our limit order and stop limit order will be placed. Though they can be placed in either order, we will first submit our limit order. We can see that the price level where this limit order will be placed is now highlighted. The order is not entered until the stop order portion of the OCO is placed. As we go to select the price level for our stop limit order, we can see that our mouse pointer provides a visual indicator to indicate where our stop order can be placed. MDTrader prevents us from placing this stop on the wrong side of the market and displays a no symbol whenever the mouse pointer is at an invalid price level for the stop. If the mouse pointer is at a valid price, our pointer becomes yellow and the letters SL appear, and we can place our stop limit order. Once we select the price limit for our stop-limit order, the TTOCO parent order submits child orders and begins working both the limit order and the stop-limit order. When we hover over either of the OCO's working child orders, we see both are highlighted to indicate that they are linked. You can cancel or modify the price of each order independently by simply dragging and dropping. Once our limit order is filled, the TTOCO automatically cancels the stop-limit order. We can also enter a TT-OCO order from the floating order ticket. Here we have a market grid displaying several contracts. We have an open short position of 10 e-mini Dow futures contracts. We can click on the position to launch our floating order ticket with the quantity field populated with the size of our position. We select TT-OCO from the order type drop-down menu and set our stop order type as Stop Market. With TT-OCO selected, we are provided a new field Let's enter the desired trigger price for our stop order here. Finally, let's enter the price for our limit order and click Buy to enter our OCO order. We can see our working orders in MDTrader as well as in our order book. Our limit order at $18,368 and our stop trigger order at $18,380.
