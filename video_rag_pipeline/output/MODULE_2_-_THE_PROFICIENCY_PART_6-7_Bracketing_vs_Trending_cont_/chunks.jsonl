This is the less frequent kind of top you're going to see. As you can see in the chart or in the volume profile, we have a lot of TPO overlap at this high. So you can see almost the S, the T, the U, the V and the W print almost all sort of sitting at these prices, these higher prices being advertised, but there's a real lack So it's almost like buyers and sellers are saying, well, we're happily accepting that the market is now trading these prices. So again, we can see that this is just almost like a slowing type of momentum that's occurring at the high of the day. Some of the questions we need to ask ourselves when we talk about these three different tops being formed is firstly, remember when a market is moving either up or down, I like to have a phrase and just remind myself that it takes time for a big ship to turn around. So remember the market equally is a big ship so it does take time to turn around a lot of the time and knowing this again will keep you from maybe fading very aggressive but also it'll make you just be a little bit patient to wait for some form of objectivity that the volume profile can potentially show you. What you can see in this example is how we can see that real loss of momentum. We got the initiative early on from buyers and then there was just a real lack of That was sort of a clue that a potential loss of momentum was occurring. Now remember, when we get this loss of momentum type top, it's not a particularly strong top. It's merely just a short-term turning point where buyers don't want to initiate higher just yet, and so at that point we start to get a little more two-way trade. Now, some of the questions we need to ask ourselves when talking and thinking about these kinds of tops is, what kind of volume is being traded at the extreme? And what you'll tend to find is that there's not aggressive kind of volume, but a lot of two-way trade between buyers and sellers. So we will see a lot of trade being facilitated at the highs and lows. And remember what we said, in a very strong auction process, we don't want to see at what we deem premium prices or discount prices. When we see this high amount of volume being facilitated, it's telling us there's quite a lot of acceptance at that price point. And remember, highs and lows are not made on acceptance, rather they're made on sort of initiative being taken from sellers at higher prices, as prices are advertised", "transcript": "So our first example, as you'll recall, is the one where we just simply lose momentum.
