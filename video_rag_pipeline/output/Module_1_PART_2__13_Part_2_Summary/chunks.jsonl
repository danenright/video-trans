Now you've completed the part two principles, let's summarize. Let's go through all the principles that we've spoken about in part two. I'm going to give you a few graphic examples just to ensure that you do understand everything I've been through in part two. So, we first spoke in part two about the key market participants and we said there three types of participants or major categories of participants you're going to find within the marketplace. We said the first was the commercial okay and the commercial that included our big banks, it included our hedge funds, it included just our regular funds. So all your really big influential market moving type institutions that have got a lot of volume and are able to influence and maneuver the markets. We then said that we have in our second category our speculators or our speculative market. This will include obviously hedge funds to an extent, maybe some banks, a lot of local uh... you know sort of strategies and then in our third example we spoke purely about sort of automated strategies and that automated strategy would include our algo's as well as obviously some day traders obviously a lot of day traders have got uh... automated type of strategies and we said those are key three major categories of participants in the market now Knowing that is not as important as to, you know, understanding the characteristics behind every one of those participants. And the key characteristics we want to understand with regards to each one of these is, firstly, the goals. What is the goal of, say, a bank or a hedge fund or a fund? Their goal is to utilize liquidity, get big positions off, hedge big positions, take, buy bonds because regulation says they have to buy bonds. By understanding that, it's so important. A lot of traders that I come across, day traders, we tend to assume that we are the market. We forget sometimes that the market was actually created for the likes of a pension fund, for instance, that needs to take the regular middle class person's pension and needs to take that pension and invest that pension. you know, sort of capital preservation, you know, we tend to think everything is about capital appreciation because, you know, we're speculative in nature, so it's important to firstly understand what is the goal of each one of the key market participants. We then said the second key characteristic is the objective. In other words, what are they trying to achieve, right? An automated strategy is literally looking to take a one tick increment and then get out and take profit.", "transcript": "Excellent. Now you've completed the part two principles, let's summarize.

We then said the second key characteristic is the objective. In other words, what are they trying to achieve, right? An automated strategy is literally looking to take a one tick increment and then get out and take profit. So they buy here, take one tick and get out. Whereas a speculator may be saying, well, I'm gonna buy here and I'm looking for it to target that point and I'm gonna hold it either until I hit that point or I'm gonna stop out there. And a long term, you know, sort of objective to invest over a period of time and ensure that the fund is fully invested in the market. So again, it's important to understand the objective of each one of the key market participants. We then spoke about execution styles. So important guys, and this is where a lot of people forget, an automated strategy, in comparison to, say, the speculative market and the commercial market. Now, a lot of the time I find myself as a trader, because I'm a day trader, I understand the way in which algorithms make a noise all day. I understand how their little strategies occur, and sometimes I can benefit from that, but only because I understand their style of execution. Equally, I understand how banks execute. the key market participant being a bank or an HFT or a fund, when they step into the market I know what it looks like because I can see the execution style. And as a result, that's giving me an edge. When I see big banks, big paper coming into the market, I'm not going to sit there trying to utilize fading type strategies. Why? Because I know that their execution style is to continuously go with the trend all day long. So it's so important to understand the execution style. And then last but not least, we spoke about the time horizon. You know, their time horizon is far, far longer. I mean, we're talking, you know, from days to weeks to months to years, okay? Some trends, you look at the bond trend, for instance, I mean, it's been the last 40 years we've been in a bull market, right? You look at the equities since 2008, 2009, we've been in a six-year, seven-year, almost eight-year bull market. So again, so important to understand the different timeframes. Commercial paper, a lot longer, whereas your automated strategy is much, much shorter, be either short or long. So that was what we spoke about with regards to our key market participants.

Now, the crucial thing was, I gave you a nice table there, which identified the six characteristics of each one of these, and those characteristics, I'm gonna write them down here for you very briefly. They were sort of fundamental. or technical, and then time frame, and then liquidity, are they a user, are they a user or a provider, and then price sensitivity, order size, and influential. I don't want to spend too much time as you've got the table, but it's so imperative, guys, that you understand how every one of these timeframe participants, what the characteristic is. I'm going to do a basic example. A long-term institution is very influential on the market. A long-term participant is going to have massive order size. They are definitely not price-sensitive, the long-term institutions. They're not a provider, but they're a user of liquidity. They tend to execute over longer-term timeframes, days, months, years, and they focus far more on fundamentals, whereas if you go into comparison with that, the complete polar opposite, scalpers are very, very technical, they have very short-term timeframes, they provide liquidity to the market, they're very, very price-sensitive, small order size, and not influential at all on price. key to understand all the characteristics. Now I'm not going to go through all those characteristics but what I'd prefer to do is I'd prefer to spend a few minutes going over examples. I'd prefer to go over a few examples of each one of these participants and where you would likely see them execute. So our first example, let's just tidy this Our first example is our scalper now what I'm going to do is I'm just going to draw a basic day type So let's say that was the high and that was the low so we'll call that the low that was the high now Let's say the previous day or the next day. We're sitting very much firmly inside of the previous day's range Okay, so let's say that was the previous day's candle a nice big candle.

We're sitting very much firmly inside of the previous day's range Okay, so let's say that was the previous day's candle a nice big candle. We'll call it a green candle Okay now so we're trading within this day's range now In between, so when the market's sitting inside the previous day's range, it's most likely that all the activity that you're seeing is very much the scalper and maybe the day trader. Remember, they tend to provide liquidity. So their job is to take the market to a point where a liquidity user can step into the market. So that's why we would most likely in this example see a scalper and a day trader. If for instance we took out the previous day's high, suddenly, okay, of course If this was a very important high, and maybe it initiated some stops or a responsive buy order, we might suddenly see the short-term trader step in and buy through that previous day's high. So now all of a sudden, we have both the scalper, the day trader, and the short-term Again, you could find some sort of swing traders stepping in or long-term traders depending on where price is, but remember the key to these last two participants is they tend to interact where they feel the markets are trading at either a discount or a premium. In this previous example you can see we're very much still trading in and around the previous day's range. So let's take an example now where we would see the long-term trader or the intermediate example of, say, a longer-term timeframe flag. Now, a very traditional long-term pattern. As you can see, let's call this maybe a three-month flag. We can see the market's pivoting in and amongst a support and a resistance. Now, note, we had the initiative leg up in the market, and the market seems to now, every time it gets to higher prices, some profit-taking. So anyone long takes a bit of profit at higher prices. We then get some initiation at lower prices. Now in this example what you tend to find in between this range over time, right, you've probably got scalpers, you've got day traders, and you've got short-term traders. Now where the intermediate and swing traders will step in will be most likely at these points. As for the longer term traders, they would have initiated this move from much lower down.

So once they set the trend in, they're very unlikely, it's very unlikely you're gonna see long term traders stepping in at the highs here. The point at which you do see the long-term trader stepping in at the high, that is the point that you get the continuation pattern. So in this example, when we finally break out of this daily three-month flag-type pattern, what you would tend to see on the break is you would tend to see the short-term trader, the day trader, the swing trader, the intermediate trader, and the long-term trader all initiating for a continuation pattern. Can you guys now see with this very basic example why it's important just to when you look at a market try and interpret Who is maneuvering the market? Who's moving the market around because when the longer term and they're the you know The swing traders are getting involved that is when you know So the market is going to hold certain prices and and trend in certain prices Whereas when the shorter term time frame, you know, the liquidity, you know providers when they're in the market All right, you're going to get a lot more two-way trade or a lot more noise as we call it. So that's what we spoke about with regards to our various time frame participants. Once we completed that then we moved on and we spoke about the basic auction process. Now very briefly, just to brief you, we spoke and we said time is our first crucial principle and what does it do? It regulates each opportunity. And then we said our second and we noted that price is an advertisement. It advertises the market and then we said volume is effectively our measure of success. So how well price is auctioning? We said those are the three key principles that make up not just the auctions in the markets but the any auction you you know, a wonderful auction of a car, and the key principle I wanted you to take away from that auction, and if you didn't quite pick up on it, I'd like you to go watch that video again, but what I was trying to get across with that auction is the bid, the style of the bid, and there's a few key things to understand about that bid was, you know, the aggressiveness of the bid.
