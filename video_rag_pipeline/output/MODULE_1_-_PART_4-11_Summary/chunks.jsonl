In part four we spoke about four key elements and the first thing we spoke about was that keyword anomalies and we identified what a few types of anomalies you can get. Now remember an anomaly is anything that sticks out from a normal distribution. So, in theory, prices should distribute normally. If they don't distribute normally, and anything that stands out like a sore thumb, it's called an anomaly. Now, the reason we talk about these anomalies a lot, and highlight them so much... is because they give us not just key understanding of the markets or key ideas and observations about the market, but we can develop strategies based on those very anomalies. The first thing to identify was some basic types of anomalies. We spoke about, for instance, a low volume area. We spoke about a bad high and a bad low. distribution. Now, again guys, this is very much the basic types of anomalies. As we get to part two and three, we're going to go very extensively into these anomalies. I'm going to explain to you what a lot of these anomalies mean in terms of who's in control of price, but then more importantly, how we can utilize those anomalies and take advantage of them. They've gotten a little bit too aggressive on price, and they've created this anomaly. Bang, you can take advantage of it. Equally, if a market is very quickly moving, performed a very bad high because there's a lack of momentum and impetus, well we know at some point that that high is going to go. As a result, if we get a little bit of structure or a nice strategy, we can then lean on it and we have an obvious target that we need to take out. That's why we spoke very briefly about the anomalies and what they mean. Then, just to draw you a little basic example of what a nominee will look like, if I was to draw a low volume area, I would take something like this for example. So let's say we spent the first half of the day inside a nice normal distribution and then in the afternoon suddenly we saw some initiation and prices started to move higher before the market again distributed. We will talk about this quite a bit in part or module two and three, but markets typically, sort of almost 80, 90% of the time markets are distributing or channeling or trading within brackets. Now it's important again to understand that because when they do trend or when we do get initiative, which again we'll talk about in module two and three, we don't want to be standing against that initiative.", "transcript": "Excellent guys, welcome to part four summary.

So that was the first example. A bad high or bad low is simply where the market you know comes up to a high for instance. It prints a TPO which is a time price opportunity or a letter for instance and we printed one letter X and we and then we printed a Z so we printed what we like to call a triple top or a triple TPO so that was another type of anomaly that we spoke about and then obviously a non-symmetrical distribution so we know that we want our profiles to look nice and normal if however we get a distribution where the marker kind of you know very thin at the bottom very thin at the bottom and then we kind of get a nice little bit of higher acceptance. We know that non-symmetry represents something to us. It tells us something about the market at that present time. So those were some of the anomalies we spoke about. We then moved on and we started to talk about the basic process of trading with volume profiling. Now this is kind of the key summary. It's almost like a part one, two, all in a nutshell, and this is the crux of where we're going to go to in Module 2 and 3 is now that I've given you the basic foundation of volume profiling, when we get to Part 2 and 3 we're going to start developing strategies in a very specific manner and that manner was in a three-step type approach. The step one was to identify the key matrix. Step two was and a subjective analysis and step 3 was we want to identify the anomalies. Now by the end of module 1 you know what you should be able to do is you should be able to do all three of these things perfectly without thinking they should be instinctive you should be able to take any kind of a chart have a look at a chart and complete all three steps. By completing all three of these steps, you are creating the single foundation or the building blocks called process.

And by developing a process to develop strategy, you are ultimately building the one thing we've spoken about, which is edge. So that's why we do this. That's why we take a structured process approach to building strategies. Anyways, let's take a basic example. So we would take an example of say a one week distribution. Again we're going to use this idea of we distributed for a few days, we accelerated higher and then we distributed for a few more days. Now step one would be to identify the key metrics. our value within our range, our initial balance, any potential tails or anything like that. So that would be step one, identifying the key metrics. Step two, we would then say, let us be objective. Let us draw two columns, objective and subjective. And let us go and identify every factual, you know, non-biased, non-subjective point that we can find in this chart. It's a fact that there is a low volume area that exists. We can see that. Okay? Let's say we opened on the low of the week and we closed on the high of the week. It's a fact that the market opened on the low and closed on the high. Okay, so these kinds of facts we want to go and list them and the reason is that when we look at a chart We want to be able to say well this this week or this day or whatever that occurred Look relatively strong and open on the low it closed on the high buyers were in control throughout the entire session Okay, and that's why we remain objective because if we are objective What we can then do is we can lean on that objectivity to sort of almost back up our ideas or back up our Subjective analysis. So now what would subjective analysis be? Let's take an example So again, let's utilize the idea that we open on the low and we closed on the high We call that a full-bodied candle now We know full-bodied candles or or sort of opening on the high or closing on the low shows our strength from the bias Okay now Subjectively, we could say, we're looking for some form of an extension at some point in time. So that's subjective. In other words, we've got this idea in our head that there's strength coming from buyers because of how we view the market, and at some point we're going to see an extension. Now that's an opinion. It's a bias. I'm forming an opinionated bias based on what I see.

Now that's an opinion. It's a bias. I'm forming an opinionated bias based on what I see. It's important to understand the difference between what is objectivity and what is subjectivity because when the next week comes, let's say for instance we take out that high, right, we know that because of the objective points we've determined, right, once we take out that high we can initiate longs looking for continuation. Because we've finally gotten that objective fact, which is we've taken out the previous weeks high or the previous days high, and that objectivity gives the subjective idea it's groundwork, it's the key elements to being able to execute that trade. And then the last step would be to identify the anomaly, so again we identify that Maybe we had a very aggressive single print tail, so we had lots of Ks here and a single print tail. Now, we identify those anomalies because those anomalies give us important clues. For instance, if we had a very big K tail on the low of this example, that is telling us that there were some very aggressive buyers that stepped into the market as the price was being advertised at a discount. There's some key support there. Some buyers, some really big influential buyers, thought that this was discount and they very quickly moved the market away from there. So what happens when we retest that point? Remember we said in part two or three, we said that a tail is important for two reasons. One, it shows us some strength, it shows us an observation, but then equally it becomes a key pivot when we return to it. It's telling us a lot about the market nature. And that's why we identify the anomaly. So that's what we did then in part four, in the second part of part four. We then moved on and I started talking to you about some of the providers that you can use. And I hope you guys got a good idea of what some of the options are available to you I'm not going to go through it too much the crux of it is all right. You're going to be getting a TT platform and You're going to, as you know by now, I've shown you how to set up that TT platform, I've shown you how to set up your ladders and set up your profiles, how to just adjust your profiles so that you can extract the information you want to see.
