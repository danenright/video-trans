Now, first thing to point out is that the gap day strategy is actually a reversal type pattern. Now, a lot of you would always have been taught and would have thought about the gap day as a sort of momentum trending type strategy, but a lot of the time these gaps do fail and that's why they provide us with particularly good reversal opportunities. What I'm going to show is I'm going to go through the three types of rules that you can apply to when we have a gap day, but then more importantly, I'm going to show you exactly where the reversal play comes when we have a gap day. Now just think about that for one second. Imagine if every single time you had a gap day. Imagine you had an almost step-for-step process as to how you could execute just Now, more importantly, imagine if you had a strategy that was working, say, seven, eight or nine times out of ten whenever you had this gap there occurring. That is why I'm going to show you the strategy and that is why this is a particularly powerful and profitable trade strategy. Firstly, let's just go through the basic gap rules when you do get a gap in the market. The first thing we talk about when we get a gap is whether or not this gap is being created by fundamentals or whether it's being created by technicals. It's important because when we get, let's say, we get some new fundamental information, whether that's an election vote, whether that's a new huge piece of industry information, whatever it may be, when we get that fundamental that comes into the market, the market is going to change its personality or the way that it moves in a very significant way. And the simple reasoning behind it is that there is positioning in the market. and now all of a sudden we've got this new information in the market, those positions need to be adjusted, whether some people add to those positions, whether some people hedge those positions, or whether some people stop out of those positions. The mere fact that we've got a new fundamental piece of information in the market means that we are going to get a hive of activity and volatility, and that's important to understand because volatility means that the market's personality is going to be very appear very aggressive. Now, as day traders, a lot of the time, this volatility can make you fear what the market's actually showing you. Now, what I will say, remember, whilst there is a higher risk attached when there is higher volatility, there is also a higher potential for opportunity.

If you embrace the volatility, take on the volatility, you will get the potential upside if you apply a very basic strategy. Now, in terms of a technical gap, this is merely where we've had an overnight move in the market and this is forcing whichever market you're trading to open on a gap from the previous day's range. Now, the three basic rules to a gap are as follows. First and foremost, you have to ask yourself if this is our previous day and we gap The question is, will that gap fill? That is the big ultimate question. Does the gap fill? Now, rule number one, if the market opens on gap, there is a high probability the market is going to attempt to test that gap. It's gonna try at least to fill in that gap. Now, one of three things can happen. Either the market fails to fill the gap on its attempt and the market then continues to sort of distribute below the gap. Two, the market can fill in the gap and re-enter the previous day's range, or three, the market can fill in the gap, re-enter the previous day's range, and even potentially re-enter the previous day's accepted area or value area. Now we're not going to look at option one, or spoken about option one, the gap and go type day. What we are going to talk about is the reversal play which is option three, whereas the market actually re-enters the previous day's range and then re-enters the previous day's value area. Now remember what I said, we are taking one specific element or one strategy that we are going to employ and utilize when there is a gap day in the market. So let's get straight into it and get the recording going. Now the first thing to point out is that we're looking, in this case, at an example in the German 10-year Bund and our key levels or our key reference points are first and foremost the 32s, which is our gap from the previous day or our high from the previous day. Then our second key area of reference point is the 26s, which is the value area high 13s, which is our value area low of the day. Now what we're looking for, we're looking to see how the market responds at these three reference points.

Now what we're looking for, we're looking to see how the market responds at these three reference points. More importantly, as I go through the characteristics with you, I'm going to show you the execution style or where you want to be implementing a reversal strategy. The first thing to point out is that we can see the market has opened on gap. So we've opened roughly with a 6-7 tick gap. The market has now attempted to move itself higher. Now what we want to pay attention to first and foremost, remember what we said, rule number one, does the market manage to fill the gap? So we can see that the market's opened and it's yet to attempt to fill the gap. Don't forget when a market is open on gap, it is opening out of balance, in other words by definition a market that is out of balance is going to show a lot of volatility. So remember it can take a little bit of time for the market to at least test the gap. Now what I would say, what I would use for instance in a German Bund example is I would as a reference point for the marker to test the gap. So either this M or this N print, I would expect the marker to at least just test or see if that marker can actually test in and around the gap. Now as we can see the marker is coming with an N print, it's coming with an N print So first and foremost we could see the market comes into that gap area and straight away the market bounces off. So it's kind of telling us we're filling in the gap, we've now filled the gap in the market, but we're not willing to enter into the previous day's range. So at this point in time, in this example, we still need to be buyers of the market. There's no reversal option here, there's no reversal strategy. The gap might be filled, but it does not imply we want to be short traders yet. Remember what I said to you, the key to this trade setup is execution. You have to perfect the execution. You have to be patient to wait to take on this trade setup. Now again, notice how the market bounces off and we get a little bit of a rotation higher. So we can see the market is just merely rotating in and above the gap. So rule number one, remember we said does the gap fill? And we can see, we can give that a tick, the gap has now filled. Do we re-enter range? Re-enter the previous day's range. And that's the second clue to this trade setup. So we are now about to see this market re-enter into the previous day's range.

Okay, is that the market will hold the gap or it will hold the intent or the initiative taken from the gap for as long as possible. So what I mean by that, if for example we have a gap day as illustrated. Now, you will constantly see buyers keep trying to defend this gap, keep trying to hold this gap for obvious reasons. If you were long from this point, you're substantially on side now, so it makes sense to hold on to those longs for as long as possible in the case that we get an aggressive move to the upside. So let's just pause that now and see what's just occurred. And note how the volatility has shifted. So we can see we had relatively small ranges, we had a nice pickup in the P-print, and since then the ranges have been relatively small over the last five sets of TPO's. All of a sudden on the V-print, notice the shift in volatility, notice the range expansion that's now occurred. More importantly, we're now not just back inside the previous day's range, but we value area. Now, the key consideration, the key thing to understand is remember we had buyers defending the gap. We had buyers holding so long as the gap held. We then saw some stops. So we've now seen, as soon as we entered the previous day's range, we've seen a few of those short-term buyers give up on those long positions and we've gotten a little bit of a stop out or the volatility of the downside.

What we want to see now is we want to see the market close back inside the previous day's value area and then and only then do we initiate our strategy. Okay?

Now, as you can see, the minute the market closed back inside the previous day's value area at that point, we then instantly rotated to the lower end of the previous day's value. So, again, in terms of execution, this was a relatively quick example, we can see below the 25s, we then got the move all the way down towards the 12s. Now that is the trade we're looking for. That is the execution we're looking for. We're looking for that confirmation, and the minute it confirms, we're looking for short side trades back down towards the previous day's value where we look to cover and take our profits. Now, I know a lot of you are looking at this going, saying, well, it's not really, there's not a great deal of opportunity there. If we look at what we've taken in terms of reward, it's probably only equivalent to 50% of the day's range. But remember what I said to you, gaps, by definition, are volatile, okay? So once the market gives you that little bit of a hint, that little bit of a clue, More importantly, because the market's volatile, because there's short-term positioning in the market, you're going to get paid relatively quickly. Now remember, when you sit in a trade for a relatively short period of time and can get paid relatively quickly, you are executing with a very good, or a very strong advantage, which is that you're taking on risk for a very short period of time. And that is why this is a particularly strong to not just learn but also develop. Let's continue playing now and see what the market does over the rest of the session. Now very often what can occur particularly in the example of a fundamental bias is the market can actually continue to aggressively reverse in the opposite direction and the reason is simple. We spoke about the buyers defending the gap. And we spoke about how the market will hold long so long as the gap holds. Now what often happens is when there's a huge fundamental in the market, buyers don't give up. In this example, buyers wouldn't give up that easily simply because they are stuck in a bias based on the fundamentals. And that means that when we, for instance, have a move lower, it's not actually sellers moving lower.
