In the next slide what I'm going to do is I'm going to take you through each one of these steps and I'm going to show you how I would apply them to the volume profile before the day begins or before the trading session begins. So some of the things I will discuss with you is firstly, what is the opening call? What day type did we have on the previous day and what kind of day type can we expect What type of open can we expect? Then, are the markets bracketing or trending? What is the value area location and what does the value area from the previous day look like? Any control factors in the market like tails, gaps, low volume nodes and high volume nodes and what are some of the nominees that could potentially be filled out? I would then develop a hypothesis both in a neutral bullish and bearish case based This is a very, very basic summary or very basic template that I would complete every single morning before my market opens so that I'm fully prepared to take on the markets. In the next slide, I'm going to show you an example now of how I apply this template", "transcript": "Here is a basic trading profile metric sheet that you would complete once you've done all the other 11 steps as discussed in the previous slide.
