Out of all the traders who've had the longest careers and I've been in The traders that still exist today, and I'm talking about traders that I met that had more experience than me Well when I started had been trading for a couple of years ready or traders You just started off to me who are still around today, and not only are they still around today They still around today, and they still are incredibly large and successful traders who really obliterate the market with their size. I mean, these are core individuals and we'll be interviewing some of them and rarely, rarely key is routine. I mean, some of these traders might not have the greatest exercise regimen. Most of them do. but what they do have is an unrelentless routine. These are traders who have had the same routine for 15 years. You know, the time that they wake up, the time they go into the office, what news wires that they read, how they do their debriefs at the end of the day. And this routine, why routine is so important, because if you have a consistent routine, you're able to consistently see where... things need tweaking. When your routine is all over the place, you don't understand what is actually working or not working. Without a routine, you're unable to tweak the necessary parts of your game to become brilliant.

Simply because they know it's unsettled them is so critically important. So from the moment you wake up in the morning, making sure it's the same time, to the moment you step into the floor, it's the same time, to the moment how you prep, how long your prep is, how many hours you focus, what you eat for lunch, what you eat for dinner, your practice regimen during the week, your relaxation regimen during the week. All of these. a routine based is the for me one of the most important and I look at the traders at AXIA who've been around for many years all the younger guys who are now already coming and developing into great trading athletes is because of the routine that they follow. Just remember if you have a routine you're able to see each part, you'll be able to segment your day and see where you're slipping up in your performance and if you can start isolating the segments you're able to really perform optimally.
