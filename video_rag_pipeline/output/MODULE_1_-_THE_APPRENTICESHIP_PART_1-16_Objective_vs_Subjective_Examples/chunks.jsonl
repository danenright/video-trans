Remember what we said. Objective is fact-based. Are you being objective in your trade, or are you being subjective in your trade? What we're going to do now is we're going to go through a couple of examples, and I see this all the time. what I want you to do as we go through each example is I want you to put your idea before I answer it for you I want you to tell me whether it's being objective or subjective and hopefully by the end of the slide you'll get a better understanding as to why it's so important to remain first and foremost objective with a little bit of subjectivity. So our first example, the US labor data non-farm payrolls It's the most highly anticipated data piece out of the US that comes out on the first Friday of every single month. Now, here's the example. So on any Friday, choosing a Friday, the non-farm payrolls rises 320,000 but it was only expected to rise 180,000. So straight away, there's a huge piece of information in the market and prices need to reprice. The US dollar should rally 1-2% given how strong the data is, okay? Yes, it's subjective, why? We don't know how far the US dollar should rally. Nobody knows how far the US dollar should rally, alright? It could go up, it could go down, nobody knows. To say that it should go 1-2%, given how strong the data is, is very subjective, it's very opinionated. The US dollar could initially see buyers enter given stronger than expected data. Now this is a far more objective statement. Why? Because as we can see, the US dollar should see buyers. In other words, we are basing our statement on fact. In other words, we know if we get a much stronger US non-farm payrolls, we should see, factually, we should see buyers. We might not, but factually we should see. Then our third example. The US dollar could see buyers enter with a high probability for a trend-like move. However, if buyers are unable to sustain a strong bid, this implies strong sellers are using liquidity to execute large orders. Now this is a mix. It's a tricky one. It's a bit of objectivity with a bit of subjectivity. But note how we're being objective first and foremost with a little bit of subjectivity. could see buyers enter with a high probability for a trend-like move. That's our objective statement. Our subjective statement is that if the buyers cannot sustain a bid, it means that sellers are utilising the liquidity to execute large orders.", "transcript": "Let's now further develop this idea of objectivity versus subjectivity.

That's our objective statement. Our subjective statement is that if the buyers cannot sustain a bid, it means that sellers are utilising the liquidity to execute large orders. Now this bit of subjectivity comes from experience in trading the markets over non-farm payrolls. then a little bit of subjective. It's important to have a mix of both but always rely on objectivity to make your trading decisions. Why? Because it will protect you in the long run, whereas your opinion will only cause you damage. Now our second example, as you can see the E-Money S&P 500 has gapped lower because of an aggressive overnight sell-off after the unexpected Brexit decision. So a lot of you would have seen this example, a lot of you would have come the next day and said well the UK's left, it was never expected, you know, this is the worst thing that's ever happened, all we got to do all day is sell, sell, sell, sell, sell, sell. A lot of you would have been dragged into a subjective idea there, why? Well because CNBC, Bloomberg, Financial Times, Wall Street Journal, all of these publications were telling us that is what should happen. Therefore straight away we all put our sell side hats on for the equity markets and we said well Our opinion is the same as the media, therefore it must be right. Was that the case? Let's have a look. So, our first statement, the market can bounce because it's oversold. Can it bounce? Should it bounce? The market can do anything, guys. Is that an objective or a subjective statement? It's very much subjective, it's opinionated. The market can bounce because it's oversold. These are the kind of questions you want to be asking yourself. Then the next example. There is a high probability for a gap and continuation. Again, now with experience and our strategy, we know that because the markets have gapped, we know that there's a high probability for continuation. Alright, we've seen the gap, the marketer showed us the gap, and we are therefore remaining objective with the information that we have received from the market. Our last example, if the market trades to my key support, I will buy it for a bounce. Okay, here again we've got a little bit of a mix. We've got an objective statement as well as a subjective statement. Why? Because if the market trades to my key support,", "transcript": "But note how we're being objective first and foremost with a little bit of subjectivity. could see buyers enter with a high probability for a trend-like move.

So the fact that we're saying if it trades to my level means we are being subjective. However, because we are trading it or I'm buying it for a bounce, I'm employing an exact strategy, I'm remaining objective. By allowing myself a specific strategy with a subjective opinion, I can have an Okay, so just ensure there's nothing wrong with having a subjective opinion or an idea about what should occur.

Then our next example, WTIO-L has sold off on oversupply fundamentals, but Goldman Sachs thinks there is a possible correction likely. Okay, so if I see a buying tale on the 60 minute candlestick, I will buy with Goldman's comment. Well, notcha, okay?

In other words, I'm allowing the market to show me an objective outcome before I execute a subjective idea. I'm being objective. Then, our next example. If I see a low volume extension of the current day's low, I'm going to fade it with a $1 stop given how important Goldman Sachs' opinion is. Again, it's a trick.

Again, this is clearly subjective, why? What is oversold? Yes, some people use overbought and oversold tools. But those tools are based on so many different varying parameters, one man's oversold might Don't forget that lagging information isn't necessarily objective information.
