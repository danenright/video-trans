As you can see the first example is a non-symmetrical trend day. Now what's important here is not too much about talking about trend or it's just understanding the basic shape of non-symmetry and why non-symmetry is a particularly important principle for developing very strong trade strategies. So what you can see with regards to the trend is how for the entire day we've seen initiative being taken by sellers in this example and they keep selling and selling selling and eventually they run into sort of stronger response of buying. And that stronger response of buying is what allows the market to almost just bounce a little bit and distribute and trade a little bit of two-way trade. Now the important thing to note is that this non-symmetry or this lack of symmetry creates very good opportunity for us. So by that very token, non-symmetrical trend days are fantastic opportunities and Not to worry though, we will spend a lot of time talking about trend and how you can develop strategies based purely on just simple non-symmetrical profiles. The second profile then is a very good example of short covering. As you can see with that caperent, we can see initially the market opened a lot lower and ran into some very very aggressive responsive buying. That buying drove prices up to such a point that the sellers were forced to liquidate Eventually, the market ran into fresh response of selling. That fresh response of selling managed to stop the flow of buying and we saw two-way trade ensue. Interestingly, what we saw was the sellers eventually overwhelmed those buyers and took The third example is a B shape or long liquidation. Again, what we can see here is that the market opens, it tries to move high, the buyers try to initiate higher prices before running into very aggressive responsive sellers. Those responsive sellers keep selling those prices and buyers are forced to liquidate by selling out. This takes prices down up to such a point that we run into new fresh responsive buyers. When that occurs, we then start to distribute and form two-way trade. It's so important you focus and understand these three basic non-symmetrical shapes because we're going to talk a lot about these shapes as well as develop unique", "transcript": "Let's take a look at some of the typical profiling examples you would see when talking about non-symmetrical profiles.
