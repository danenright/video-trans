It's merely price. volume and time being depicted. Again, this time not necessarily on a volume profile, but on what we call a price ladder. Now the reason I like to show people this is just to bring you back to the basic elements of what markets are. It's merely just an auction. Now a lot of you would have watched maybe a few YouTube videos of the old days when the pit guys used to stand opposite each other and spit and shout and yell at each other and point what we have today is nothing more than a pit auction, it's just being represented a little bit more differently on what we like to call a price ladder. So what you have in front of you is that price ladder. As you can see on the left side we have a blue column. That blue column depicts all the bids or all the buyers at various prices. So you can see the prices in There is a buyer representing a number of contracts. He wishes to buy at the the various prices We then have on the red side the offers so the sellers so the prices at which sellers are willing to interact We then have the high of the day which you can see is the highest try a traded price on the day We then have the volume profile. So again we spoke about how volume is one of the crucial three pillars with price and time. So what we can see is how volume is being distributed over all the prices traded on the day. And again, note, we will talk about this volume dispersion and what it all means not just in terms of interpretation but in terms of trade strategy. Now note, as you can see, just an example, 1607 lots are on the offer in this example. In other words, there is a seller at the price 3079 that is willing to sell 1607 contracts. Now again, as prices move up and down and the volatility picks up and down and the volume picks up and down, this amount of We then have, obviously, what is physically traded through the market, so important to understand. A lot of the time, buyers and sellers might represent or show the market one thing, but when it actually comes to transacting and executing, they may do something very different. So, as you can see, that 6 represents the actual last trade, in other words, the last traded amount of contracts that has gone through this market at any given point. We then have the low of the day and then note the bid of 3003 lots at the price 3069 again This is the price at which the buyer is willing or this is the amount of contracts at which the buyer is willing to buy at", "transcript": "Now what you have in front of you is something that's actually quite exciting to see.
