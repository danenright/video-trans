It's quite a unique trade strategy but do bear in mind obviously it is a bit more of a scalp type trade opportunity with very good risk reward metrics. Now again we're going to go through the template of it again there's no right and wrong answer. Just a couple of answers and a couple of things I want to point out with you now. Do bear in mind, obviously, you're going to see that as we go through all of these units, my answers are quite concise. I try to keep things very concise and very to the point in these templates. In the beginning, obviously, I want you to be as expansive as possible in terms of your understanding whilst you complete these templates. But over time, you're going to start to learn to quickly not just complete these what the information means. Now we're going to start off again with a strategy observation. First and foremost, in terms of market context, you know, is this best found in trending or consolidation markets? Now note I said obviously in trending conditions be cautious, okay, simply because when we do find an elephant in trending conditions it can very quickly extend beyond that elephant. So we said we'd ideally like to see this more in a consolidation type phase. as is a much higher probability. Now do note, avoid this strategy in times of OPEX or Rolls, simply because the price action and the liquidity being provided can be relatively misleading. Now note in terms of balanced or imbalanced markets, we said we can find it in both, but the most important aspect to remember about the strategy is someone sitting there providing liquidity, the market extends beyond that point, once it gets back above that starting point of providing liquidity, we see an extension in the upside. direction. It is that simple and that's the key premise of this trade strategy. Now in terms of trade location, ideally we do tend to see this mostly at extremes. Why? Because this is a more obvious location for someone to step in and respond to high or low prices and ultimately provide that desired liquidity or be that elephant in the market. Okay now in terms of market conditioning some of the time frame participants you can expect to see well they are going to be large okay to provide that kind of liquidity you do need to be a relatively influential large participant ultimately they are initially providing liquidity before taking it so that sort of size can only really be a large time frame participant. Now note in terms of liquidity this is the key proponent of the strategy this is So the tip, don't forget, was what is high relative volume. That's the key, you can obviously learn to see what an iceberg or an elephant looks like, but it needs to be relatively high. And do note when we obviously saw that relatively high volume that failed, do note that it can, obviously, you need to learn to differentiate between", "transcript": "Now the trading strategy of hiding behind the elephant makes a lot more sense to you.
