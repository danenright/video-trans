Now this is effectively the name comes from the mere fact that we are after a trend day up, we are merely on the second day after a trend. The day two trend is a wonderful strategy for a number of reasons, but most importantly is we have got an entire overnight session to prepare for the day two trend. So you've got a lot of time to almost prepare how you're going to manage and execute your trade strategies in the day two trend. Now, why that is quite advantageous is because the day of a trend is notoriously known to be quite volatile and quite a lot happens that forces almost a trader to respond very quite infrequently, so they do tend to test different skills that a trader has when we do have a trend day, so it's quite nice to have a little bit of time just to assess and have a think about how we're going to execute the day after a trend. The important thing to understand before we go through the different variations of a day two trend is effectively what types of trend days do we get. Now the two types are the fundamental trend day and the technical trend day. Now the reason these are important, as you'll see in a second, is that they create In essence, when we have a fundamental technical day or a trend day, the day two, there is a much higher probability of a secondary trend day as opposed to if it was a technical trend day where there's a higher probability of a distribution type day type. So with that in mind, let's have a look at some of the variations of a day two trend that you can expect to see.

The third type of example is whereby we have the market trending on day one, the market then opens again on day two, shows initiative through the highs of the previous trend days high and continues again for the second day of trend. These are the three basic patterns that you will see on the second day after a What's important to understand is that when we have a fundamental that's created the trend day, it's highly likely that we get a second day of trend. However, when we get a more technical trend play, you're more likely to see the variations number one and two. Now let's discuss what effectively creates this idea of a day two trend or a distribution Now, it comes down to something very simple which is when we have a trend day, we know that we have an initiative move in the market. Now what occurs on day two is not necessarily that there's a lack of, in this uptrend example, not that there's a lack of buying, it's just there's a real lack of commitment to at the extreme or at excessively high prices, and as a result what tends to occur is we get a little bit of momentum through the previous day's extreme, a lot of short-term algorithms and day traders tend to buy through that extreme as there are very often some short-term stops above the previous day's high, but once the market fails to sustain the momentum above the previous day's high we then see the distribution occur and some profit ensue from anyone that is still long. As a result, obviously the market then rotates lower and we form a sideways market or a distribution. Now, some of the trade setups that you can expect to find, well the three major trade setups that you would want to take on a day to trend are as follows. First and foremost, we look for a retest Now, this is probably one of the highest probability trade opportunities and simply put, if day one is a trend up, the probability of us retesting the previous day's high or at least extending it is extremely high. So what you have to ask yourself very early on in the session is what is the trade If we are trading relatively close to the previous day's high, again the reward relative to what it could cost us is quite high.

However, if we are trading in a much better trade location where we may see some early initiative taken from buyers, that then is a much higher probability trade location. a distribution type play. So in this example we want to watch very closely what occurs on the previous day's high. Once we take out that high but fail to sustain higher prices and fail to sustain the momentum, once we re-enter the previous day's range we can then execute short side trades looking In terms of managing risk, we merely put our stop above the point which would prove this trade wrong. Now the key thing to understand with regards to the second trade setup is that we are going against the short term trend. Now as a result, that means that we do want to be making sure we manage our risk effectively but also ensure we don't look for too much or too big of a target. then the highest probability trade opportunity on day two after a trend is the probability of an initiative wave. So what do we mean by this? Well, in the example of an up-trending market, at some point over the course of the day, the market is going to pull back potentially to a point where we will see a wave of initiative buying occur. Now, if you go through a number of day two trends, you will see over a period of the day, there is one point in the market where we do see this initiative wave. Now why this occurs is very simple. On day one, we have a trend day. Now, a lot of people do miss out on this trend and don't manage to get on the trend. As a result, they're not willing to commit to higher prices, but they are willing to commit to any kind of a pullback. And that is why on a day two trend, at some point we get an initiative wave. And it's that initiative wave that creates for us a very strong trade opportunity. Now, the key to interpreting that initiative wave is we want to see a sudden shift in the volume and the volatility within the individual TPO's. I will show you in a bit what this example looks like.

If at any point as the market pulls back, as in this example, we see a little bit of initiative or momentum against the trend, that gives us almost perfect price entry. Why? Because we should not be seeing momentum against the short-term trend. That would be a key entry, and again, I will show you as we go through the next couple of slides what this may look like. Now, just one thing to interpret with regards to the expectation analysis and the emotions. Remember, the psychology of traders the day after a trend day is that of they've missed a particularly good move in the market. What we do tend to find is that traders become a little bit relaxed the day after a trend when it comes to their risk. So, it is imperative that you just watch and be patient with regards to this trade setup. Don't be caught out trying to look for the low probability trade, which is a second day of trend. Make sure you're patient on your execution. Don't be looking to be buying in bad areas. Rather wait for that pullback where we might see an initiative leg in the direction Now, let's move on to what some of the examples might look like. So as you can see on your chart, the first example, we have a trend day on day one. Now note how the market extends on the previous day's high but leaves a relatively aggressive selling tail above the extension of the previous day's high. It then comes back inside the previous day's high, rotates towards the low before Now, this is very typical, the most common day two type pattern you're going to see. Let's have a look at some of the other examples. So, in this example of the WTI Namex oil, if we look at the individual rotations, notice how very early on in the day the market sort of rotated a little bit lower, but then gave us that initiative leg. The key to this initiative leg is notice the sudden shifting volatility in the X, the Y and the Z time prints. As we can see, if we were patient for this market, we got a little bit of momentum against the trend, so notice the S-print, against the trend, opened, sold off, but rejected very quickly, leaving what we would call a hidden tail.

Then notice again, notice how the market showed us momentum against the trend, giving us a second potential opportunity for long side trades. Again also notice once we did obviously extend on the previous day's high, we failed before creating that downward move. So that would again give us that second potential opportunity for the fade opportunity. We had a very, very aggressive sell-side price response, much higher volume, and a substantially large candle which gave us the third opportunity for a long back towards the highs. Now the key to this, as you can see, is that there are three basic elements. Two, there's a high probability we're going to extend on the previous day's extreme, but also potentially fail, and that gives us the second opportunity. And three, the market is likely to give us an initiative wave with the short-term trend, and we need to ensure that we take advantage of that as well. Those are the three kind of plays you would expect to see in the day two trend. As you can see in this example, the EURUSDFX, again notice how we extended on the previous day's low. Notice how if we go to the individual auctions, we can see how the market sold off and retested below the previous day's low, giving us our first opportunity. Our second opportunity came back inside the previous day's range. It did test higher but failed, so note in this example, it did not pay us to More importantly, however, we did get the opportunity, again, to enter our shorts as we retested the previous days low and the market held lower. So again, not quite picture perfect as the three examples I've given you, but again, the basic premise of the trade idea is there and that is the key to this trade setup.
