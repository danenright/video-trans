And the markets we'll be looking at over here will be the gold market. So we're looking at the gold and it's the daily chart. And then we'll also be looking at crude oil over here and we're shifting in time frame. down towards the 60 minute and then finally the German bond futures so the Bund chart and we'll be looking at the five minute chart. So as we're mentioning in this module on this slide what we're trying to look at are different types of ways from the price ladder to determine what these reversals actually look like. So when the market reverses a trend and starts auctioning towards the other direction, what does that look like on the price ladder? What are the early indicators? What are the clues that you see at those points? What is the reason what the market reversed over here? And what are the reasons why the market reversed over here? And what does it look like on the price ladder? So there are a couple of different ways. your traditional volume surge blowout tops where the market exhausts all positioning as the market goes on its last crescendo as you can see in the crude 60 minute so you have this really expansive move over here this big green candle which is associated volume sessions and the following day the market completely reverses towards the downside. And that is what you call a classic blowout reversal as the market really capitulates towards the, well not capitulates, blows up towards the upside and unravels all the positioning of the market and the market loses positioning and the typical personality you see in this is a volume surge followed by lack of ability to the market to hold its auction at every price and the market gets rather rather blippy and when you see that blippy type action or low volume nodes existing at the extremes that are being protected well then you start looking for potential short trades towards the other side and we look at those plays in our strategy video later on then here is a different type of a reversal where the market moves towards the upside and Just puts in these kind of doji candlestick patterns and they're characterized by really low volumes So relative to these volume peaks the volume activates Sorry, the the volume activity really starts slowing down and it loses any auctioning initiative The auctioning activity at the extremes becomes lethargic becomes really tiresome, inability for the market to really make any grand upwards and you see the market just going at a very slow rate of knots of exchange, you know the exchange on the ladder becomes very slow and it", "transcript": "In this video, we're going to be looking at graphical representation of trend reversal on the charts in different time frames.

And then once the market starts moving towards the downside, well then the volume should start picking up as these positions start becoming unwound. Now this is a, so that's a 60 minutes daily chart, this is now the 5 minute chart where this massive crescendo move, this volume, much higher than any other move, so this final move, and when you, this move on the price ladder was actually trading and watching it this day, is that the whole, all the bits were being pulled and it was the final panic, and then the market at this extreme just started becoming very blippy, no strong Continuous auctioning exchange for it to continue towards the downside and what actually happened at about you know Below the 44 to the 30 to the 35 in this region over here There was an LVM so low volume notes that the market showing you doesn't want to really auction and then there was a bit Of area of activity and then the markets just started auctioning a backup after that final crescendo Moved towards the downside. So that's again. It's a type of blowout attack reversal showing you on a graphical perspective which we speak about these plays through the module and then we actually look how to execute it on the price ladder and what we look for because if you just trade after the event and you can't see the actual personality, so you might have to wait to see all the candles close. So you can't actually execute a very effective strategy by just trading off the charts, by looking at the ladder and seeing the shift in the price personality and the exchanging activity can then help you orchestrate or help you execute a very strong and profitable trade with minimal risk and a reward side to really participate in the move back towards the upside and this is just a graphical representation of what a trend reversal areas will look like and this is what we look at where the market starts moving from one extreme towards the other extreme so this is a trend reversal zone this is a trend reversal zone and this is a trend reversal zone", "transcript": "The auctioning activity at the extremes becomes lethargic becomes really tiresome, inability for the market to really make any grand upwards and you see the market just going at a very slow rate of knots of exchange, you know the exchange on the ladder becomes very slow and it Fairly range bound, but you know potential blippy activity, low volumic stage, low speed, so really low speed as well at these extremes.
