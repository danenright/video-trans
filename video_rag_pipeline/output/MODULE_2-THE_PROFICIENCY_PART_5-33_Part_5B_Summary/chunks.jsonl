So the first thing we spoke about was trend versus non-trend and we went through the characteristics of what trend looks like and what non-trend looks like. What I want to just point out and the crux of why we talk about trend and non-trend It's okay to employ various strategies that are maybe not momentum strategies, maybe sort of more distribution type strategies, looking for those tails at tops and bottoms, looking for the market to not leave a lot of the low volume areas and single prints and things we've discussed or the anomalies we've discussed previously. is expect to employ the same types of strategies that we've utilized in non-trending markets. So that was the key, and that's why we talk a lot about trend versus non-trend, because it's that context of trend versus non-trend that will determine whether or not our strategies will be effective or not. Now, we then went on and we spoke about a few of the... the types of volume profile day types you can expect. Let's briefly go through them. So our first one is the normal day type. Now, the most important thing to understand about the normal day type is that we have a very large opening move in the market so a very large range in the initial balance period or in that initial pre-cash session whether it's in the E-Moneys or the commodities or the FX market so we get a very wide initial period the market then spends the rest of the day within that initial period just filling out the market up and down and up and down and effectively relatively rare but the nice thing about them is we get that identify or that clue very early on in the session. So that was our first day type. Our next day type was the neutral day type. Now the neutral day type effectively is very similar except we have an opening trade where the market sort of has a much smaller initial range but we then extend on both sides but equally end up just distributing on both sides of the initial period. Now the important thing to understand with this day type is the close. Do we have a normal close in value or do we have an extreme close to which we need to pay attention for an early identifier for the next day.", "transcript": "We're now at the end of part five, let's just quickly do a summary of what we've dealt with in part five B.

Now the important thing to understand with this day type is the close. Do we have a normal close in value or do we have an extreme close to which we need to pay attention for an early identifier for the next day. Now, a normal variance, as the word variance suggests, is where we have a little bit of non-symmetry in the market, so the P shape and the B shape, where the P shape is effectively and we then start accepting prices higher. Equally, the B shape, which is the long liquidation, buyers initiate, they run into very strong selling, and they force lower, and the market then distributes lower. So that was our normal variance day type. Those three day types were our non-trending day types. We then had our two trending day types, which firstly was the double distribution and then the traditional trend. Now the double distribution, very simple. We have two distributions with the trend being a trending market with loads of different types of distributions. Again, these were very aggressive, strong type initiative profile trading types and they have various strategies which we will begin to develop later on in module two and three. So we then moved on and we had a very nice table, a very important table, where we identified what these five day types are, what they look like, what the key characteristics are. Remember, If you can identify a day type very early on, you can employ the right kind of strategy and take advantage of that before other people start to receive information of what is occurring. Don't forget, the more information is in the market, the more likely prices are going to be priced correctly. We then moved on and we finished with the confidence table or the level of bias and confidence in the market and we said we moved from our least confident day type all the way to our most confident day type. We then finished part five and we spoke about how the trading process would occur and it's very simple. We always start off with that intuitive slash edge feeling slash idea. In other words, we have an idea in mind, we see something, it makes sense to us and the initial, sort of, we want to respond, but that's not enough to respond, guys.", "transcript": "but equally end up just distributing on both sides of the initial period.
