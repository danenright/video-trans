Now it looks a lot like, as you can see in the profile in the picture, it's a day type where we have lots of little profiles or areas being accepted over a period of a day. Remember what we said, in a traditional trend day there's a high level of directional confidence and it tends to be evident over the entire session. As the market trends, it tends to draw in new business and thus higher and higher volume. We also tend to see a lot of one-time framing as the initiative tends to occur over the entire day and we have either the buyer or the seller being in control over the entire session. Again, also note there is a tendency to open and close within the lowest or the highest quartile and we then also close with the trend in either the highest quartile in an uptrend or the lowest quartile in a downtrend. Now, what's important to note about a trend day, a traditional trend day, is what are the early characteristics. Just like we spoke about some of the early characteristics with the normal day, the neutral day and the normal variation, we have characteristics for the trend day. Now some of the characteristics is volume dispersion. As you can see in the example, it tends to be spurs over a varying number of prices and this is very, very characteristic of a trend day. The market tends to show initiative until it finds responsive other timeframes, we then have a little bit of distribution and then initiative and then it runs again into responsive time frame and then again initiative. So we tend to form lots of little value errors over the period of the session. Another key characteristic is the low volume areas. Remember we spoke about this earlier in the module. And what you will see is that when a market is trending it tends to leave lots of low volume areas as the market quickly moves away from prices being advertised. There's a natural tendency for directional buy, so over the period of the day it'll feel as though a market constantly wants to go in one direction or another. We have very short consolidation periods, so again we see a initiative with a little bit of two-way trade, and that two-way trade doesn't last very long. If ever you felt as though a market wasn't respecting any kind of technicals or wasn't paying attention to any kind of key pivots that you had noted, this is a very very early characteristic that a market is trying to trend. The reason this is an early characteristic is because of the nature of initiative price action.", "transcript": "The first of the trend days is a traditional trend day.
