With TT Stop, you can define a number of ticks at which to trail the market, offset the submission of your order a number of ticks once triggered, define the time and force, and more. If we had an open long position of five contracts in the e-mini S&P and wanted to enter a stop order to exit our position, instead of using a native exchange stop order, we can use a TT Stop to customize the behavior. When we select TT Stop from the list of order types, we see a flyout menu where we can enter our parameters. For our TT stop order, let's trail the market by three ticks from the last traded price, and when triggered, submit a limit order. We can apply a positive or negative offset, which will place our order the specified number of ticks away from the inside market. With this stop order, we want to send a limit order one tick beyond the trigger price, so we will set the offset to minus one. We place our order and can see the parent order three ticks from the last traded price in our MD trader with both the audit log and order book displaying the trigger price. As the market rallies, our sell stop moves up, trailing the last traded price by three ticks. When the market comes back down and trades at our trigger price, a child limit order is submitted to the exchange one tick beyond the last traded price, which fills almost immediately. As you can see, TT Stop gives you the flexibility to customize the behavior of your stop orders. such as triggering your order off of last traded price, bid, or ask, the ability to trail the market, as well as providing traders the option to set a customized time and force.
