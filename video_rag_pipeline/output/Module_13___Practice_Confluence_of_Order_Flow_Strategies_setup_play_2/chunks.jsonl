And this video that we're looking at here is really macro news, so let me just make this ink a little bit smaller, so if you had to put on another strategy over here the momentum play and this is what you should be doing you should be adding to each one of these sections your own observations your own little plays within these of four really key components of the price that or four key strategic areas so it's really macro news and how do you react when you are observing breaking macro news that really changes the perception or going to be looking at in this instance over here is a breaking news out of a central bank a central bank policymaker and in this instance it's looking at the Bank of England and specifically BOE Forbes who's one of the voting members so this is how we would come out on a Reuters news feed and really it's why our traders all have their own individual Reuters feeds, simply because it's important that when a breaking news comes out you are very quick in observing that breaking news and seeing whether that breaking news shifts the whole dynamic of how people reprice assets and in this instance what actually happened is that BOE's Forbes rate hike would still leave substantial amount of stimulus for the economy. Now we do know, you know, if any of you who follow any of our debriefs on our stream, we do know that BOS Forbes is one of the hawkish members. But prior to this comment, what we had is a Bank of England meeting the prior week where they voted 9-0 on interest rates and keeping and actually forecasting downwards their rates. So being prepared on that, knowing that this was really the first Bank of England member to come out and voice a rate hike. of the market, you know, of the Bank of England where there's nine members voting for interest rates, hikes or cut, there's potentially a member that would be voting for a hike which would leave it at 8-1.

Okay, so he's executing already within milliseconds of that two o'clock headline So his first trades as he starts as he starts executing is I mean This is this is already within a few a few seconds of the news dropping He's in a position at the moment of 40 of all says there 46 lots is his position or over here It says 45. So let's continue watching and watch how he executes to the market that he enters wasn't about 123.76 123.78 so you started buying all along here and let's see where the market pops to pops to and how he starts exiting his position.
