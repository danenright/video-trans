We then moved on and we spoke about three unique patterns that you're going to see not just in this module but in the following modules and we're going to talk quite extensively about them over time and those three types of patterns were firstly trend, which can be illustrated with a lot of initiative and small distributions. P distribution where the market shows initiative from sellers, it runs so we see initiative selling, we run into very aggressive responsive buying, the market then quickly forces out the short so we get a bit of profit take until we find responsive sellers and the market sideways.

Now, the key first identifier would be tails, whether that's at the top, whether that's at the bottom. That's the first thing we want to look for is tails. Any kind of initiative from the open, whether that's an open drive or an open test drive. So first thing is, where do we open? Alright, second thing is, are we balancing or are we unbalanced? Typically, you would find that markets tend to trend from a balanced distribution. It's very unusual that we see a market trending when it's completely out of balance. It might be within range, within value area where the market opens and then drives out and shows that initiative and trend very early on. Then the important thing to understand is the control variables. We want to see control variables such as the low volume errors, the low volume errors, the multiple distributions, the multiple small distributions. These control variables are showing us the control being exhibited by the buyers over the course of the day.

Now, we can lean on a number of variables, starting with the initial balance, high or low, that can be an early identifier, but equally how we respond on the break of that initial high or low. Now, typically what you'll find is, in a trend day, you will typically see when the market breaks the initial balance, high or low, if we Typically, we would find the market very quickly auctions away from it, leaves a low volume area before continuing in that direction.

In this day type, if you're not going to go with the flow, rather don't go against it because it can do a lot of damage to confidence, to P&L, to understanding and interpretation. So that's our first strategy play, then our next one would be the P shape or the short profit taking type move that the market exhibits. Now it's very simple, the first thing to understand before we employ a strategy is what creates the pattern. Step one, we have initiative selling, so strong selling. It tends to occur at the end of a maturing trend, and we get that initiative and aggressive quite earlier in the day. So again, you will see strong control variables in this.

Firstly, when we see that exhaustive type of V-reversal, okay, we want to be ensuring that we're not sitting there selling this. on the way back up because what we then do is we're almost putting ourselves in a position whereby we cannot take advantage when it finally runs into responsive subtle.

You can use that, maybe the VPOC or the value area low of the previous day as a potential target for where we might then run into fresh responsive selling. So when you then find that response of selling at a key point, that is where we want to enter fresh shorts. Why? Because well, obviously these longs, all the longs now have gotten their move, they've squeezed out all the aggressive shorts and the market will now begin to distribute. So that would be our first entry looking for shorts, again, at a key reference point whether that's in the previous day's value or low or volume point of control. We then look to take that trade back down towards where we will then run into fresh responsive buyers. Now again, sometimes this can go quite deep. What you need to keep in mind is that we want to find that point where the market runs out of selling so we no longer see sellers responding and selling lower prices but then we start to see buyers step in and accumulate and so at that point we want to look to cover our shorts and initiate fresh longs. Now, one of the hardest things to do when this trade develops is to keep trading it on both sides because there's a natural bias to want to choose either long or short. So when you see this, the reward is doing the brave trade, the reward is doing the hard trade, and the hard trade is to be a seller at higher prices and a buyer at lower prices. So when you see this, be aggressive, do the job you need to do and take advantage of two-way trade being facilitated.
