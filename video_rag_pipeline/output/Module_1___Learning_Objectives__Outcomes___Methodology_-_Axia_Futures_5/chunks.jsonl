So that entire circle that we looked at, or that entire mechanism, that cognitive rapid skill development protocol that we employ in our learning environment. Let's just look at the first element. That first element of our modular approach is the theoretical framework. Now, we first describe the order flow pattern, or the price ladder pattern. We look at its nuances, its subtleties, and what we're really trying Then next, we start accessing the market environment. Now, the market environment is just so critical. This is probably one of the most important parts of being a great price ladder trader. Is the moment you sit down at your desk and you start preparing for the day ahead, and then when the market opens up, and that bell rings, and it's the futures session that opens up, do you have that ability to access in a very quick manner? what the market environment looks like and that really follows suit of accessing the volume and the volatility environment. Now the volume and the volatility environment which is really a sub component of the market environment and I can compare this to a great As an example, if you're a cricketer and you walk onto a pitch in the subcontinent and the ball is spinning around and you know, it's moving. It's those players who are able to adapt to those conditions the quickest and therefore deploy the right technique in order to optimize their performance and make the most amount of runs given the environment they're faced with. are the most effective professional athletes. And it's the same with the trader. The trader that then is faced with all these patterns in the various market and the various asset classes, the trader who's able to assess his environment the quickest is the trader who's able to deploy the right strategy.

You're not going to be using the slick tires. So this section is so important and it's actually potentially my favorite section of the of the entire course is assessing the volume and volatility environment in context to And then we look at the potential, and finally we look at the potential reasons for the rise of the pattern. So we really look at possible reasons, there could be a whole host of reasons, but we just dabble into the potential reasons of why this price ladder pattern could exist.
