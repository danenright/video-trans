Now the important thing to understand is to cast your mind back when we spoke about strategy one, and this was all about the low volume area. In strategy two now, we're basically going to talk about the high volume area, and all that occurs is when the low volume area strategy is complete and we start to see the low volume area fill out, we then revert to our high volume area trade strategy. We're going to be developing two sort of unique sort of patterns with the high volume area, but in essence this is nothing more than when the one strategy is complete we can then move to the second strategy. Now in the example provided in the chart you can very clearly see the two various domes on day one. So we could see the market sort of had a nice little value area up higher and then it had the initiative move and we formed a lower value area. began to fill out the low volume area, so as we can see in this example, the market initially held on to shorts within the low value area, but then suddenly began to fill it in. On day three, we then completed and filled out the low volume area. So this would be a typical example of a double distribution, but over a number of days. Now again, important to note, this strategy can occur in one day where we fill out the low volume area on the same day, or it can occur the following day or even over the following days. execution and money management you would require. Now the first thing to understand in terms of the characteristics is obviously we need the two dome shapes, the two separate high value areas. Now what we're effectively looking for is once the market has failed the low volume This is almost our sit up straight and pay attention type clue. Now what we're looking for is once the market starts to fill out this low volume area, you can expect a lot of two way trade. Now it's important to define what this two way trade looks like and I'm going to show you what it looks like. One of two things can occur whilst filling out the low volume area. and slowly but surely grind out and fill out the low-volume area.

Or two, the market can come into the low-volume area and fill out straight to the other side. before then rotating lower. Now in these two examples you're going to employ two very different types of execution. Now in the first example what we're looking to do is we're looking to ideally trade the market from the perspective of strong trade location. So what should happen in theory is the market should fill out this low-volume area where we have buyers towards the lower dome and sellers within the middle part of the higher dome. If the market, as in the first example, slowly grinds out the low volume area, this is not as effective, or at least it would still work, but it's a far slower type trade opportunity as the second one. In the example of the second one, if we do do a straight line move or relatively aggressive move through the low volume area, this gives us a much stronger short on the first time test of the top dome. Equally, if the market then moves back lower, we want to be looking for a first trade. In the first example, however, we still want to be looking for buyers, but it's important that we remain very passive on entry and execute in strong trade location. Now, let's just talk about what we mean in terms of this trade location as it is a key element when it comes to the execution. Now, what you must understand is Now, if you are going to become very good at this trade, you need to be patient and wait for the point where the market gives you a good entry. Now, the mistake a lot of traders tend to make with this strategy is they tend to enter too aggressively at the wrong time. So, what do we mean by that? If the market is trading right in the middle of this distribution, there's roughly a 50-50 chance as to which way it may go. It may fill up higher, it may fill up lower. So it's important to understand that we look for buy side opportunities towards the lower end of the low volume area and we look for sell side opportunities towards the upper end of the low volume area. Now again imperative to understand is the risk reward metrics of this. In terms of the risk-reward, we are looking for one-to-one risk-reward. Now that's not necessarily comfortable most people, but the simple reason is that it's very difficult to define risk in this trade strategy. So by that very nature, if you are buying it at this point, and you're expecting say a 10 to 15 price target, well then at least by putting a stop of say 10 prices, which will ultimately make it effective in the long run.

So, important to understand with regards to risk-reward, there is no exact stop that proves the trade strategy wrong, and that is why we try and use the potential reward as our potential stop. Now, what's important to understand again, is when the market does have these double distributions, it can take... quite a lot of time to fill out. So that is again why it's essential to interpret. How does the market fill out the low volume area? Does it move aggressively from point to point or does it, as in this example, take two or three days? quite a substantial amount of time, so do make sure you factor in time when determining how you're going to execute this trade strategy. Let's now look at another example of what the double distribution could look like. Now in this example, well this is obviously now we can see the rotation, so just in terms of execution, note we're looking for buy side opportunity and buy side opportunity in good trade location. Again notice how if we do buy in that good trade location the market does give us the opportunity toward the upside. Note this is the point, the blue line, where the low volume area begins to fill Again, then note on day two how when the market does give us that buy-side passive opportunity, we do get the potential toward the upside.

So that is the basic element of what the double distribution will look like, however it doesn't always play out accordingly. Now the second type of double distribution sort of pattern you'd be able to see then is where the market actually continues with the short term trend as in the example In essence, what happens in this example is the market does attempt to fill out those single prints. It fails and we see a little bit of two-way trade before the market, then very quickly auctions in the opposite direction. So, in this type of example, what we want to look or where we want to look to enter, if we miss the first initiative down move, that is fine.
