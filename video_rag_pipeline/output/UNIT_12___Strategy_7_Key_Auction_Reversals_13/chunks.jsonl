So whether we were talking about the symmetrical V or inverse, or even the outside engulfing candle, either case, we're looking for that secondary absorption and that's where we want to be entering in passively. Now in terms of risk, we obviously place it beyond the absorption point. Again, do note, don't be too tight on this risk, we've got really good risk reward here. So again, you can afford to be a little bit loose, well not loose, that's probably the wrong word, you can afford a slightly bigger stop given that there is really good opportunity as the initiative kicks in. In terms of target, well, as you say initiative in the opposite direction So once we get that initiative, whether we extend on the previous extreme Or we retest the previous extreme or maybe we get a full unwind of the Delta and form an exhaustion high or low Those all be key signals in which you want to look to take profits now note very crucial This is not something we want to hold overnight We don't want to assume that the market will continue with the trend that it is necessarily a key reversal. Okay That's the real key to becoming a really good trainer is to recognize that of course we'd love to stay short. Of course we'd all like to run it forever and make the biggest winners. But objectively that sort of approach is never going to allow us consistency in the long run. What allows us consistency in the long run is to continue to adopt an exact process. if however the market does close with those three parameters you know i.e a nice big tail a big volume or a cumulative delta in the direction we will then look to enter with the trend or with the continuation of that key reversal in the following session okay in terms of risk reward very high tight stop and really good reward in terms of application it's exact okay there's no guesswork here we've got a very very easy entry point very exact entry point in terms of leveraging we don't tend to leverage and the reason is not because we're afraid not because we're not convicted but simply because like I said to you it takes time for a ship to turn a lot of the time it's quite difficult and tricky to be aggressive at an extreme in the face of an aggressive trend okay so by the very definition it's okay to be a little bit nervous to take on this trade because you are going coming from the market.
