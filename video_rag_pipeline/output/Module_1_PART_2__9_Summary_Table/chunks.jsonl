Remember In order to understand the strategies we're going to use at the back end of this module, and module two and three, we need to understand the five different participants. More importantly, we need to understand how these participants interact with one another, where they tend to interact, and what type of change in price brings them into the marketplace. So let's look at the summary table. As we can see, we have the scalper, the day trader, the short term trader, intermediate swing and long term investors. I've summarised this in the 6 key characteristics that you can find amongst these 5 participants. For example, the scalper. The scalper tends to be pure price action and technical, whereas the day trader tends The short-term trader is technical and then fundamental. The intermediate swing trader finds a happy balance between fundamentals and technicals, whereas the long-term investor is purely fundamental and uses the technical to confirm the fundamental backdrop. If we then look at the second characteristic being the time frame. Scalpers tend to react on a second-to-minute type time frame. Day traders minute two hours. The intermediate swing trader days and the long-term investor days to months to years. We then turn to the liquidity provider or user. Scalpers tend to use liquidity, or sorry, scalpers tend to provide liquidity to the market. Day traders provide liquidity to the market, short-term traders provide liquidity to the market. Intermediate swing traders provide both liquidity and they use the liquidity, whereas long-term investor paper traders are liquidity users. Our next characteristic is price sensitive vs non-sensitive. As we can see scalpers are extremely price sensitive, whereas day traders are price sensitive but not as much as the scalper. Short term traders are relatively less price sensitive than the day trader. Intermediate swing traders are not sensitive and neither are the long term paper investors. In terms of order size and volume, scalpers tend to be the smallest, with day traders Short-term tend to be relatively small, whereas intermediate and swing traders tend to have larger orders and the largest orders and highest volume comes from the long-term investors and paper traders. In terms of influential and price and not influential, as we can see, the scalper The day trader is not influential, the short-term trader is not influential, the intermediate swing trader is influential to an extent, but the most influential is the long-term", "transcript": "Now that we've dealt with the 5 market timeframe participants, let's summarise them and get a very good overview of these 5 participants.
