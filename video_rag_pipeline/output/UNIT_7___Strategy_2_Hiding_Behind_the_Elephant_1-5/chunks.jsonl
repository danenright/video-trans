This is Challenge Day 10 of 30. In the following slide we're going to focus on the art of goal setting, how to define and create a process for achieving your goals. And I'm going to explain to you how to make your goals more effective. So let's get into it. Now, most of you have got this, you did this wonderful thing called New Year's Resolution and you know, you've written down a whole bunch of things you want to achieve this By the end of January guaranteed that'll be in a drawer somewhere. It'll be packed up It will be collecting dust guaranteed 99% of people. This is the case now I'm going to show you a process to avoid having you know just putting this into the cabinet after a couple of weeks Now where it all begins Is yes, okay, you need to define what exactly is your news resolution? What is it? Do you do you want to be a millionaire this year? Do you want to you know? Finally be able to buy that Rolex watch do you want to you know do your best time in a marathon? What is that exact goal so it needs to be exact you must write it down in layman's terms I want to be a millionaire I want a million pounds in my bank account by the end of the year now most people stop there that that's where They get to they write this down a whole bunch of goals, and that's where it ends now want to just show you a small way you can change your goal setting that will allow you to actually be able to manage and ultimately achieve those goals. So first and foremost every single goal you have must in one sense or another be process orientated and I'm gonna show you when I show you an example I'm gonna show you what I mean by process orientated. So for instance if we take the first example on the list they lose weight. Now Lose weight, there is a process that you can attach to that goal. Now, just writing down lose weight, that's not good enough. You have to physically create the process in order to lose weight. Now, we all know that the basic elements of losing weight is increased exercise and, you know, manage what you eat. So, straight away, you go and write down a list, you go and write down a diet, a managed diet that you follow step for step for step. If you do this, you are just that one step closer to achieving your ultimate goal. Now the next thing, goals must be measurable. Why? Because when the times are tough, when you stand in front of that mirror and you're seeing no results, when times are stressed, you want to be able to lean on those measurable goals.", "transcript": "The Footprint Course Unit 7, Hiding Behind the Elephant.

You want to be able to see some tangible evidence that actually I'm getting closer towards what I want to achieve. Those goals need to be executable. Alright, what I mean by that you know is you need to be able to have as much control in your hands as possible to achieve That goal right if you setting goals that are out of your control ie. I need a promotion I need a you know get a You know a nice wonderful tan or you have to set goals that are executable that are under your control if they're not in Your control you there's no point in setting that goal because you're just going to disappoint yourself lastly, make your goals simple. Simple will mean effective down the line. Now a goal doesn't have to necessarily be lose weight. A goal could be for two months I don't want to drink any alcohol. Something so simple but ultimately down the line the spin-offs as a result of achieving something so simple will be tremendous. Now I'm going to go through my goals with you and I'm going to show you how just one of these goals will ultimately make me a better trader. So as you can see there, I've listed four goals. Now I've had these goals actually technically for about five, six months, all right? So the first three, process, patience and productivity, those are three sort of live by goals that I have. Without these, if I cannot achieve these first three goals on a day-to-day basis, So, every single morning, the first thing I do when I get down and sit down is I write down process, patience, productivity and control. If I can achieve every one of these four things on a day-to-day basis, I am guaranteed to be successful on that day. I might not make money, I might lose money, but guaranteed I will walk out of the office and I will feel satisfied because I have achieved my goal. Now, how do these goals, how do I actually, you know, what does this goal mean in other words? And how can you use, you know, things like this to achieve your own goals? So the first one, I'm just going to go through process with you. Now, when I write down process, what do I actually mean? Well, the first thing is that I have a routine. Every single day, I arrive at the office at the exact same time. It's 6.32 a.m. There's no surprises, no secrets. It's 6.32 a.m. That's the time I get there. I can sit down and then at five o'clock when I do my debrief I can say did I arrive according to my routine and if I did I give it a tick. Then I need to read the fundamental rundown. I need to have my breakfast at 7 30 a.m. I need to ensure I never lose more than 30 percent before the cash open or 30 percent of my allocated capital.

Now if I achieve all eight of these step for step process orientated little goals, mini goals, ultimately I give myself the big tick which is today you achieved your goal of process. That's all it is guys. Every one of those eight examples, every one of those eight processes are in my control. They're 100% my decision, my choice. Can measure them easily I can see did I actually physically you know take a break at 1130 if I didn't well I failed at achieving my goal Can I execute them can I physically at 5 p.m..

Have a look at the strategies actually can I physically yes, I can execute them are they simple Well, there's nothing more simple than at 730 a.m.. Having breakfast in the morning If I go through every one of these eight things I give that number one a tick and I've achieved my process goal. That's all a goal is guys. You have an end outcome. Of course my end outcome is to make a lot of money. Of course my end outcome is to do my job well. Of course my end outcome is to you know want to look good.
