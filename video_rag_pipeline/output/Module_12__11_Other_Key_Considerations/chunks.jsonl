So it's really important in understanding the timeframe you're trading for the momentum play. The timeframe, whether it be whatever chart you're trading, you've gotta understand that depending on the timeframe will start to depend on your holding period. If you're executing a daily breakout and you're executing on the five-minute structure, just make sure you need to give the trader to breathe after the initial move, depending on how far you're looking for the trade to go. So really consider the timeframe, as well as understanding the intra-timeframe analysis. If you have a great. Pattern that you've seen or you've been watching the ladder that at 55 to the upside It's been it's been hitting that level for the last week You know ten times every time it approaches that level it loses momentum and loses its lethargic Becomes really lethargic and it has that same exact same price personality every time it trades there Well the tenth time that it trades it and on the tenth time you notice that well your price memory Remembers that every time it trades it. It's only going at ten trades per second, but the next time it starts going there, just before that, it starts trading at 200 trades per second. Well, now you know the personality has shifted and you're watching on the daily charts, you're now able to execute on the five minute chart, you're seeing a change in the one minute chart, and all the, it's an entire collision and joining of timeframes. And when you have that confluence of timeframes for a momentum play, that's when you can execute with a lot of aggression on the ladder. Remember, the larger the time frame breaks, the power of confluence between time frames is really important, as we have just mentioned. And also important to understand seasonality of momentum moves and structural changes of the market. potentially, you know, late September, October, November, into December, as the larger time frame participants or institutional funds start closing out their books for the year. So you start getting these trend-based flows and then at the beginning of the year, you know, from, you know, mid-January, February, March, you get initiative activity of people start engaging more risk into the market, so you get another. And then the summer months, the European summer months, you get a lot of plays in the market during those months and therefore knowing when you're going to optimize and when you're going to deploy your momentum breakout strategies and what seasons they operate the best. So really understand the seasonal nature of the markets. You're not going to be wearing your summer coats, you're not going to be wearing your bikini or your costume in winter and you're not going to be wearing your winter coat in summer when it's 30 degrees outside. in what market conditions will really determine success in the daily success of the strategies", "transcript": "Okay, now let's look at some other key considerations when we're looking at these momentum plays.
