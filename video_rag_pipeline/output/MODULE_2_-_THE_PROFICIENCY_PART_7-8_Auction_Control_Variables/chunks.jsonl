You get two main categories of control variables. One will be control variables that show strength and the other that shows weakness. This is again, very important principles that you need to think about when looking at the auction process. The first we'll discuss are strong variable control identifiers. point of control location. So straight away, where that volume point of control is, it identifies where the fairest price is on the day. So again, this is a very early clue as to where buyers and sellers feel fair value is. The second control variable is the closing price on the day. So again, if we close at the absolute extreme, whether it's the top or the bottom, that's showing us an identifier of strength that's being shown by either the buyers or the sellers. Then the location of the value area as well as the shape of the value area, so if we have a value area that's situated towards the top end or the bottom end of the day, again that's showing us that there's high likelihood for at least a continuation, whether it's a drift or a trend, at least some form of a continuation or movement in the direction and then obviously the shape of the value area, you know long elongated value areas, you know we tend to show us probably a lot more one directional type trade, whereas when we have narrow small little value areas, again that's showing us a little bit more muted balanced type trade. And then range, expansion and volume, like we said, you know, when we have the expansion of volatility, you know, that's quite an important control variable we want to pay attention to, as well as when we have relatively higher volume or lower volume, that's again showing us a control variable we need to pay attention to. Our open type, so if we have open drives and open test drives, again that's showing us strength or a strong control variable early on in the day. And then our trend characteristics, if we see those trend characteristics that we spoke characteristics are early identifiers that there is control by either the buyers and sellers in the market. And then last, tails, these tails are crucial, they do give us an early identifier of strength in the market and we need to pay attention to these variables as they can be indicative", "transcript": "We're now going to move on to the section of control variables.
