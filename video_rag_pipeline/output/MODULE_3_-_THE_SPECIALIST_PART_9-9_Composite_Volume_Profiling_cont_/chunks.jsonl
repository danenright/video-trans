The first example you can see in front of you is what I like to call a fundamental composite profile. What is this? Well in basic sense, it's when we have a new fundamental in the market, whether it's a change in supply and demand in the oil market, or whether it's a shift What I like to do is when I see these, you know, trending type fundamental news enter the market, I like to draw a composite profile. Now as you can see on the left of this chart, well on the right of this chart we've obviously got all the candlesticks but on the left we've drawn a composite profile. Now all that composite profile shows us is how volume is dispersed over this entire move from the lows Now, as you can see, when the new fundamental news hits the market, we can see very little volume being traded in the lower end of this distribution of volume, or in this volume profile. Whereas, once the market finally runs into some responsive type selling, we tend to see value being accepted, or the market developing fair price. Now, it's very important and you can see why it's so powerful to use these compster profiles because we can very quickly pick up where the market has rejected or where the market feels was a discount price and then where the market feels is. fair value price. Now, where I would tend to use this quite a lot, or how I would develop trade strategy based on this, is so long as that fundamental news holds in the market, I'd be looking to keep buying the low end prices ahead of that low volume area or that area of prices that very little volume was traded over. Let's take a look now at another example.", "transcript": "Now in the following slides, I'm going to show you a few examples of where I would use composite volume profiles.
