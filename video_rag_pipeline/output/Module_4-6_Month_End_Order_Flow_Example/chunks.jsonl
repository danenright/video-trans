So now let's have a look at this on the replay environment. Okay, so as you can see at 70 fives over here, we've got already 300 orders go through here and whilst it's trading this price 400-500 and the bit keeps on reloading watch over here So we know we're gonna bid a one-notch here and again, there's 20 lots have gone through again It rebids itself. You can see as it goes down it consistently rebids itself So the market has now gone it towards 76 or so We can add a few more say 400 lots have gone through there. So 500 lots now the market is starting to aggressively pick up. Mark has come back to 76 but you can see the rebidding. I've been watching the order book.

You can see the bias as they... As they hit the bid you can see the buyers just reloading themselves and now the market, you know Stacking 400 lots 400 lots you can see now didn't take much to make it go bid at 77 You can see what's going through the ladder over here another hundred lots up there 280 lots That just went through another hundred hundred and thirty up there So you can see the market is a really starting to move a little bit more aggressively as you see that that buy side activity Continue over here. So now we one more minute into quarter pass form we're just observing and watching the actions the velocity slowed down a bit but 300 lots have lifted the offer over here There again, so you can see the activity. So if you were over there, you could have re-bid the 78s as you saw that activity. And this is the type of activity that momentum traders love to trade at extremes. But now we're trading into range and you can see this activity. Now we long here 75s, long here 76s. Now the market has found some interest resistance. You can see a 1000 lot has come in there. At 78s, he's now caused it to offer back down. So you could have booked potentially some of your ticks come back towards 75, which is a key pivot area reloader was. So we're watching really closely now. At the moment it's at 1,000 lots. It stands in the way at 78, but someone keeps on rebidding. So they're using the 1,000 lots to potentially get long at 75s and 76s over here. Now we are really approaching this key time. No, 1,500 lots. So you can start adding some size, but I think, you know, it starts... Coming towards this region over here, so we've bought some more at 78. You can see the 600 lot, 400 lot, 800 lot. It's come back towards the 78 over here. The 78 where we saw that reloaded is bidding, bidding. Look at the size coming through the market now. As the market really starts taking off, you can see the activity happening on the ladder. So you can start booking some of your prices as now the orders are slowly subsiding. So you can get out some of your lots at the moment, between 75s and 77s and that type of brief action where you see the activity happening on the ladder whether it's just you know 10 ticks before a key level 161 say 98 is a key swing high But if you start seeing the big orders coming into the order book, you know 10 ticks below that instead of waiting for that Well, you could be leveraged up heading into that level and that is really the true power of the ladder He's seeing rarely when the orders get active as opposed to waiting for a you know, a static linear level The markets are about orders orders are what activate movements not you know levels can trigger potential order movement But it's when the orders come to the book and the orders can come in whatever prices or whatever range whenever one any big institution Needs to execute anything well, then that's", "transcript": "pick up.
