Now effectively an HFT is an algorithm that operates at extremely high speeds, it's talking almost about nanoseconds and it is important because there will be a whole bunch of different algorithms all with the same strategy, but the ones that are able to at a quicker speed will get the price that they want. So it's almost a race to, you know, on technology, on latency, and how fast their orders go from the broker to the exchanges and back that all an HFT is, is just an algorithm on time steroids, just really wanting to get those orders filled as quickly as possible. I've given some links there to describe a little bit more about almost the technicalities of algorithms, I mean so on HFT systems, the co-location, a co-location meaning of their service being located at the exchanges and then the order, striking distance to the exchange because their servers are at the exchange so look into those those various links that I have provided over here will give you a really nice broad understanding of of the HTT systems and really the importance of speed for them in order to really optimize their performance and there's a whole There's a whole variety of types of different HFT systems. I've provided some further links and further reading there but I'm not going to be going into this in detail just for you to understand. These are just another form of execution strategies that do exist in the marketplace and therefore exist on our price ladder and it's when we observe them that we're able to trade around them Various different types of orders at particular times of the days and then how do you trade around those orders?", "transcript": "Now let's define HFT or High Frequency Trading Systems.
