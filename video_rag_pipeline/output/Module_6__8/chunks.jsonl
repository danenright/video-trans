Now we haven't crossed that area yet but this is what you will be using right at the end after you've done all the modules to use this. You know, print this out, put this on your desk, laminate it down and really use this to make your, you know, to really enhance your learning. But for the sake of this exercise, we're the volume level and the market vicinity and then once you've done all the other modules you can use them in conjunction once you've gone through the momentum absorption flippers large orders and reversal zones play so what am i trying to say yes so let's just have a look so if we are putting and we looked at this video earlier on but let's just press play over here and again we're just going to have a look at what we want to be watching so Over here we've seen, we've discussed what velocity is. So if the market is trading here, now again let's actually, so let's just put this at the normal speed and let's again have a look at our Example over here. So what we're looking over here We we're observing and and as we watch it on the week, you know first just always have trust with yourself Always have the trust in your own intuition and the trust in your own learning because you only build upon Your learning day in day out in the beginning. It seems a little bit confusing But as you start observing, you know later in the week your brain starts putting the puzzles together So on your first day you look at this and you say okay there at the moment The velocity, so the speed of the exchange over here is actually rather low, so you might market on your little matrix here, you might write that velocity level in this area is low. So you should say the velocity is low. Now the auctioning between the exchanges, so there's actually auctioning, there's no prices being pulled or the market is going one direction, there's actually being auctioning happening. too high.

Then the volume, you know volume or the liquidity of that on the book is is fairly chunky, say on an average is two to four hundred lots on the bids and the offers and the volume that's going through is is high as opposed to 20 lots on the bid on the offer which could be low so you could say volume is medium to high and in the market vicinity at the moment we're intra-range so if so we we mid-range volume level you know is fairly good velocity is low auctioning activity is is high and as you start doing this day in day out you start noticing you start understanding speed levels of your market at the moment you can understand the various speed levels of your market you can understand its degree and ability to move up or down.

But that's like I said at the end of all your modules but for now what you really want and making, you know, use potentially every hour, what you've noticed in specific hours, well, how good was the velocity? How good was the auctioning activity? How good was the volume level? And how good was the market vicinity? And this is really important to understand how to develop your skillset in understanding the market environment. And once you understand the market environment, you then can understand what's the optimal environment for these types of plays. So what's the optimal market velocity environment? this being defining the market velocity environment, what is the optimal environment for these types of plays. And I put just a brief little template for you so at the end of all your modules, you can refer back to this. And as an example, a great momentum plays happen with high velocity, high auctioning activity, high volume, and you want it to be at the highs or the lows of the day. And then you can refer to the other ones. Okay, so good luck with your exercise.
