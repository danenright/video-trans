There's always an element of risk in anything you do, and the important thing to understand If you can break that barrier, that fear of taking risk, you will become far more successful.

We said the key to it was we want to wait for number one, the gap to be filled, and then number two, we want to wait for the market to re-enter the previous day's range, and number three, we want to see the market re-enter the previous day's value At that point we looked to trade between the two value areas. We then went on and we spoke about our tail reversal trade strategy and the key takeaway from that was the type of tail, what's created the tail, the length and depth of the tail and we spoke about how that tail is in essence creative but also more importantly forward and the key takeaway from both these strategies is that if we are patient and we", "transcript": "Now, what we spoke about in this section of the module was we started talking about the concept of a certain uncertainty, and the key to that was that at the end of the day you have to take some form of risk.
