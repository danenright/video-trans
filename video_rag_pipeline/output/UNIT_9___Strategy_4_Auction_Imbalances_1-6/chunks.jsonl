So you're going to see a couple of examples of some of the effective habits traders at AXIA have but ultimately you want to adopt some of these and develop your own. The first one, obsessive morning routine. The most successful traders not just at AXIA but across the city of London. They have this obsessive morning routine. Okay by obsessive I mean they are there pinpoint the exact same time Monday to Friday. It's obsessive. It's crazy We're talking about, you know, some of the biggest traders not just in the city But in the world that have been doing this job for 10 15 years still come in at 6 30 a.m Now there's a reason to that. Okay, that has become so imperative to their success That they could they could almost not be successful by being in at any point after 6 30 a.m So that is a real habit. It's a habit being in at 6 30 a.m. Is a habit The next one trade the opportunity not the clock. Okay successful traders. There is no clock now You know my partner gets very frustrated in there a lot of time because she says, you know What time are you gonna get home? When are you gonna be back and I say well, who knows? Okay, there is no clock when it comes to trading There's only opportunities. If the markets are moving around, if there's a Bank of Japan, if there's something going on in Australia and we're trading the European markets, there is no clock. We don't care what the clock says. We're there for the opportunity. Form the habit early in your career when the markets exhibit opportunity. Don't look at the clock. Don't work to a clock. Work to the opportunity. That is something that again a very early in my career I noticed to you know about day traders But also even this point the most successful traders don't look at the clock. They look at the opportunities Healthy diet healthy lifestyle healthy mind, okay It's no secret you come on to our trading floor and you look what the guys eating for breakfast You look what they're eating for lunch.

We're talking salmon and spinach for breakfast and then we're talking, you know, all sorts of crazy, nutritious, healthy food that he's taking on. Why? Because at the end of the day, if you've got to sit there for 10, 12 hours and focus and perform at the peak, you have to have a healthy diet. Right? Healthy lifestyle. Traders don't go out drinking during the week, okay? These Twitter pictures of people sitting on a beach drinking a beer, trading off a laptop. That is absolute bullshit, guys. I really, really hope you know it's absolute rubbish. Okay? A healthy lifestyle is being at the desk, being healthy, making sure you've gotten maximum amount of sleep, that you're mentally always focused, mentally always strong. Okay? Regular exercise. On any given day, most of our traders will be forming some form of exercise, whether that's cycling to and from work, whether that's doing yoga on Wednesdays that we do regularly at AXIA as a team, whether that's, you know, doing half Ironman training, whether that's doing Jiu Jitsu, whether that's doing kickboxing, whether that's doing, you know, we've got all sorts of guys doing all sorts of exercise.

Any trader you ask them that has made some degree of success as a day trader in the industry will tell you they're always at their desk at the top of the hour as best as possible okay and it's because a lot of the time news releases and you know commentary from central bankers always Back in 2011-2012 there was a period of Bank of China particularly releasing interest rate hikes at the top of the hour. So guess what, traders developed a habit of always as best possible if they wanted to go out for lunch. It wasn't at 1 minute to 12, it was 1 minute past 12. They developed this habit, why? Because in the long run this habit made them money. Then winning trade routines and losing trade routines.

I know the position he's in but every time he takes that loser He gets up pushes his chin and walks away Takes three four minutes away comes back starts again It's a fantastic trade routine that he's developed for himself that works for him Equally, a winning trade routine.

Again, I bet most of you have never thought about the concept of risk warm-up. It's just like professional athletes. We have to stretch. Why? Because first thing in the morning, your conceptualization of risk is very different to later on the day. Why? Because over the period of the day you're taking on a lot of trades, right? Which means that you are warmed up to the concept of what risk means and you know you're far more or far less risk-averse first thing in the morning than you are later on the day. Okay, it takes you time to get into the flow into the momentum into understanding where the risk is So most professional traders have a habit first thing in the morning.

That structured morning briefing allows them to be in a very specific mindset before the markets open. It's a technique called priming. You've got to prime your mind to be in the right mental state before the market opens. So every morning you prime your brain to be ready come the open of the markets. It's the same thing in the afternoon. Our most successful trader, OK, and it's so wonderful. It's something that, you know, I'm very weak at and I've been so fortunate to see for so long now.

It's something that really really does You know make the footprint tool extremely valuable now note obviously In terms of the the execution style we will adopt be adopting predominantly a passive execution style So as with every unit of the strategy sessions, we do focus on all the principles and which ones will be utilized in the strategy session. As you can see again, multiple principles will be utilized in the strategy session, but some of the key highlights, one of the most important ones is volume, so obviously high volume areas and low volume areas, as well as delta pocket positioning and Do note, obviously, we identify our imbalances with nice, bright green lines.

But for me, the reason I really, really like auction imbalances is not just the strategy focus, but more the principle of auction imbalances, in other words, what Now, what I mean by this is that sometimes as traders we get so focused on a strategy and a market doing something that we almost ignore all the other information coming towards us. And that's where the strategy can be so wonderful because auction imbalances are giving us Like I said to you in the last strategy session, trading is not just about having your subjective ideas and executing them. It's about having the fact-based observations from the market and executing upon those.

So what you can see there is just a basic footprint tool. Now in balances, we always observe diagonally. Okay, so when prices are going up, we observe them in that direction When prices are going down, we observe them in that direction Now an imbalance is nothing other than a really big degree of variance in a volume traded between two prices Okay, so if we highlight maybe these two prices we can see 6 by 200 Okay, so that discrepancy of a hundred and ninety four lots is what we call and imbalance. Now remember the footprint is nothing other than a tool to show us the interaction between buyers and sellers. So when the interaction shifts, when the nature of how buyers and sellers are interacting shifts and changes, that provides clues but also opportunities. Okay and ultimately that's what the markets are about. You know the markets in theory spend you know most of their time in sideways motion and then every now and again they It's about knowing when these imbalances are in play so that we can ultimately go with the flow of the market Equally, you know if you're someone that likes to go counter the market You always need to be aware of these imbalances because again, you never want to go against a market when there is an imbalance Why because the very nature of an imbalance is that there is a lot more strength", "transcript": "to put a stop in place on another strategy you might have.

Okay and ultimately that's what the markets are about. You know the markets in theory spend you know most of their time in sideways motion and then every now and again they It's about knowing when these imbalances are in play so that we can ultimately go with the flow of the market Equally, you know if you're someone that likes to go counter the market You always need to be aware of these imbalances because again, you never want to go against a market when there is an imbalance Why because the very nature of an imbalance is that there is a lot more strength", "ocr_text": null, "visual_caption": null, "metadata": {"chunk_idx": 5}}

We can see this imbalance is 194, we can see this imbalance is 160, this imbalance is 300 and this imbalance is 500. So the imbalance is nothing more than the difference between the contracts traded on the best offer versus the best bid. Now, if you want a further explanation of why this is important, you need to think a little bit about a price ladder. Okay, so the markets come down, and it's come to this price point 60. Now off of this price point 60 we suddenly see a really big imbalance in the market. The nature of the price action has shifted very very aggressively. And this is how it shifted. In other words, buyers have bought 194 more contracts at the best offer versus sellers. In this instance buyers have bought 160 contracts more than the sellers at the best offer. Buyers have bought 300 more at the best buyers have bought 500 contracts more than the sellers at the best offer. Okay, so in other words it's showing us that buyers have become very intentional to lift higher prices. Okay, now what it also means is that ultimately there are sellers Offering up those in prices and this is key to understand not just is the imbalance important ie very strong buying But equally if this becomes a very dark and very red and there's a lot of absorption That's telling us that not only are the buyers becoming aggressive But equally there's potentially some sellers caught in the market, and that's one of the key principles We're going to focus on which is high Versus low imbalances so low volume imbalances As a general rule of thumb, make a note of this, low volume imbalances will tend to reverse, i.e. fill out the imbalance. High volume imbalances will tend to continue initially and later come and fill out. So that's the key thing, an imbalance is actually an anomaly, it's an anomaly within the auction process. For buyers to suddenly become this intentional and this aggressive, we always have to ask ourselves, why?

Some people prefer to have some sort of a minimum difference, otherwise, very simply put, if you had, let's just say, an example like zero and ten, and you had your imbalance set to whatever, two, three, four, five hundred percent, it's going to always show Okay, so for me, sometimes it's good to maybe have some sort of a minimum difference, maybe if you had 10 contracts as the minimum difference, therefore, if you had something like 0 and 40, obviously it'll discount the first 10, which means the imbalance is only 30, whatever percentage it'll still show up as an imbalance okay but having that minimum difference might just get rid of a bit of the noise.

In other words, real offers are being lifted. The buyer is being that aggressive and he's lifting very high amounts of volume. That sort of imbalance shows us a strong auction process. Now the counter or the flip of that is a weak auction process, i.e. where we have In other words it's low amounts of volume or 1 by 6 or again 20 by 140. This is a far more weaker auction process than say for example we had much higher numbers you have 200, 200, 300. I will show you some examples in a bit but just understand that basic premise, a strong auction, we're lifting high amounts of volume as we're going in the diagonal way of course and a weak auction again diagonally but we're lifting very small Now, the basic premise, the rule of thumb, a strong auction won't always reverse straightaway. It's likely to continue. A weak auction will likely reverse. Now, where I learned this actually, this strategy, was if you've been a German Bund trader for a long time, you'll notice that a lot of flipping comes into the market around about lunchtime, midday. Now this flipping very often will look like a weak auction imbalance so if you want to learn to trade this one of the best times to trade this in say for instance the German buttons is around the lunchtime so 11 o'clock to one o'clock in the European session. Okay now I'll go through the variances or the variations of the strategy in a minute but let's just talk about some of the other principles. Now imbalanced versus imbalanced markets okay so imbalanced market again Like I always say, a market that's out of balance, so i.e. we're trading relatively close to the previous day's extreme or even outside of the extreme on either side. For me, you tend to see much stronger auction imbalances at those extreme points, I'd be far more cautious to fade those.

In an imbalanced market, we are likely to see more of these imbalances, whereas in a balanced market, you know, where we're trading smack bang in the middle of the previous day's range, we are likely to see more weaker type imbalances which, like I said, tend to reverse upon themselves. Now, note, I've mentioned the high and low volume, that is a key pivot, as you will see, also the delta. Okay, so the two key metrics we're going to pay attention I think the shading is really, really important because that's going to show us the relative shift and those are the three key metrics we're going to pay attention to when we get to the examples. We expect to see dark shading for strong auction imbalances, high volume for strong auction imbalances and high relative delta. Why? Because we're lifting very big offers and obviously the flip for weak auctions, we won't tend to see much dark shading, the volume will be relatively normal and Okay, now in terms of why this imbalance occurs, this is quite important, okay, so sometimes an imbalance can occur because of stops, okay, so maybe the market reaches a certain point and suddenly we get a stop out, okay, now stop out imbalances do tend to fill out, why? Because naturally when a market stops out, obviously it's stopping out simply because one order is trying to get out of the market, okay, so those imbalances do tend Another reason for imbalances is when we get some key fundamentals in the market. Again, these don't have to fill out why, because those fundamentals can be particularly important. And the third reason we get imbalances is because of initiative in the market, and we will talk quite extensively about the strategy a little later on, but that's one of the third reasons why we tend to get this imbalance. Okay, obviously as I mentioned with stops, you know, sometimes we assume stops only occur at an extreme and they don't. Stops can occur in the middle of a range if there's some positioning like I showed you in one of the strategies earlier with the failed support and resistance. You can have an auction and balance in the middle of the range. Equally, when we get on to the point of a delta unwind, you'll see again some okay now those are predominantly the most important principles of ultimately the imbalance process now let me show you what the variations are going to look like and then we can start to develop a strategy approach now so important guys context matters a lot in terms of the the trade strategy okay it's it's so important that whenever you look at an imbalance and you identify it that you put it into the context of where is it trading right now, why has it occurred, is it stops, is it just a", "transcript": "far more cautious to fade those.

Okay, so make sure you always interpret the context behind why that imbalance is occurring in the first place. Now, the first thing to observe, like I said, is you can have a minimum difference. Okay, as explained, that's up to you. The second thing is the percentage. okay now this is the percentage to create an imbalance in other words between 100 contracts and 400 contracts that'll create an imbalance if i set it to 400 percent or bigger okay now again this varies tremendously okay there is no right or wrong in this but what i would say is don't go less than 200 for imbalances and don't go more than 400 Okay, the reason is if you go more than 400% you could be missing out on a lot of information If you go less than 200% you could be including too much information So the whole point of that setting is to again extract Meaningful information to only take out the information you ultimately want to know. Okay, so Again, a lot of people always ask should you have a separate chart? Okay, this depends it is easier to see on a separate chart, of course because It only shows color where an imbalance occurs. So if you're going to adopt the auction imbalance as maybe one of two strategies from this entire course, then yes, have a separate chart. Equally, if you just want to focus on imbalances then have multiple separate charts or just an imbalance chart. If you're going to trade multiple strategies and you don't have the space, then by Or a time-based and as you'll see in examples in the next couple of slides I will show you that you can learn to identify imbalances simply by So light and dark colors Okay, so you're gonna learn your eyes are gonna learn to adapt to what an imbalance looks like on the chart now note One of the most important things and again, there is no exact answer But how many prices do you need for an imbalance? How many in a row? Okay, it all Depends I don't want you. This is why I teach you principles and don't teach you exact science Okay, it all depends what I would say is that ideally you want more than three prices Okay, so you want three prices showing imbalance Ideally you want those three prices to be within a four price range Okay, so what I'm saying is you could have an imbalance there there and there and that's enough of an imbalance", "transcript": "context matters a lot in terms of the the trade strategy okay it's it's so important that whenever you look at an imbalance and you identify it that you put it into the context of where is it trading right now, why has it occurred, is it stops, is it just a fundamental piece of news, or is it just low volume.

The second thing is the percentage. okay now this is the percentage to create an imbalance in other words between 100 contracts and 400 contracts that'll create an imbalance if i set it to 400 percent or bigger okay now again this varies tremendously okay there is no right or wrong in this but what i would say is don't go less than 200 for imbalances and don't go more than 400 Okay, the reason is if you go more than 400% you could be missing out on a lot of information If you go less than 200% you could be including too much information So the whole point of that setting is to again extract Meaningful information to only take out the information you ultimately want to know. Okay, so Again, a lot of people always ask should you have a separate chart? Okay, this depends it is easier to see on a separate chart, of course because It only shows color where an imbalance occurs. So if you're going to adopt the auction imbalance as maybe one of two strategies from this entire course, then yes, have a separate chart. Equally, if you just want to focus on imbalances then have multiple separate charts or just an imbalance chart. If you're going to trade multiple strategies and you don't have the space, then by Or a time-based and as you'll see in examples in the next couple of slides I will show you that you can learn to identify imbalances simply by So light and dark colors Okay, so you're gonna learn your eyes are gonna learn to adapt to what an imbalance looks like on the chart now note One of the most important things and again, there is no exact answer But how many prices do you need for an imbalance? How many in a row? Okay, it all Depends I don't want you. This is why I teach you principles and don't teach you exact science Okay, it all depends what I would say is that ideally you want more than three prices Okay, so you want three prices showing imbalance Ideally you want those three prices to be within a four price range Okay, so what I'm saying is you could have an imbalance there there and there and that's enough of an imbalance", "ocr_text": null, "visual_caption": null, "metadata": {"chunk_idx": 11}}

Again what I would say the more important thing than the prices to focus on is what is physically being lifted here? What is the physical volume being traded? Is it high representation of volume or is it low? That's the real key to understanding imbalances. Like I said, this is a great strategy to know because it's going to assist you with stops targets All sorts of other kinds of strategies that you're going to learn. So just do bear that in mind and Then note obviously one mistake people make stops Okay stops are a form of imbalance. Okay, so we're going to say stops are an equal to imbalances Okay, it's a type of imbalance but an imbalance Okay, it doesn't equal stop. Okay. So in other words you can have an imbalance that's not created by a stop but stops are all imbalances, just something to be aware of. Now let's go over the variations as well as the execution that you're going to need to adopt for this trade strategy. The first variation is we get the initiative. The initiative comes in the form of our nice imbalance and that's how I'm going to represent imbalances. So we get the imbalance, the market extends, it runs into liquidity and once it finds the liquidity it backs off. the market is always going to try and test that imbalance. Now what you want to do is you simply want to wait for the absorption. Note this is the key. You want to see absorption in front of that imbalance before you execute. This is a mistake most people make. They simply just put a bit there. Now the problem with that is that again if you recognize it as high or low you want to see the absorption first. Why? Because it's the absorption that tells us that initiative created in this imbalance still exists. In other words, the buyers were aggressive from this point to this point and they're equally aggressive because they're still absorbing at higher prices. Okay and we're just simply looking for a little bit of a rotational retest of the extremes. Now in terms of targets, I'm not going to spend a great deal on this because the target depends on the context. If this is an imbalance market on If this is an imbalance in the middle of a balanced day, well then you could be looking to take profit for a couple of ticks. In terms of risk, it's very simple. We don't want to see that imbalance begin to fill out.", "transcript": "Okay, it all depends what I would say is that ideally you want more than three prices Okay, so you want three prices showing imbalance Ideally you want those three prices to be within a four price range Okay, so what I'm saying is you could have an imbalance there there and there and that's enough of an imbalance 2 prices, a little bit too shallow, probably not aggressive enough, 4 or 5 prices maybe being overly aggressive.

Now like I said to you in the previous strategy session, when imbalances do begin the process of filling out, be very cautious because they're likely to then spend quite a bit of time filling it out and that's our second variation. Okay, we want to look for a short-term scalp, looking to target the bottom end of our imbalance zone. Okay, so what we're looking to do is we're looking to simply play within this sideways zone. Now again, this is where it's crucial. This strategy is going to work far better, i.e. number two and three is going to work far better in balanced markets versus, oops, that's supposed to say imbalanced. Okay, so if we're in a balance market, we look to sell through that absorption low, target the low of the imbalance, and then cut and reverse on the low of the imbalance, and trade it back up. Why? Because we know the process of an imbalance market is to fill out the imbalance on both sides. Okay, so we're just simply using a principle, and we're adopting a strategy according to the principle. Let's go through it again. Step one, we always trade in the direction of the imbalance. by buying the market. Target depends on the context. Once we take out that absorption zone we look to be an aggressive seller targeting the low end of the imbalance where we cut in reverse and buy the market. Okay, now what we're going to do is we're going to go through a couple of examples and then hopefully you'll get an idea of what it looks like a little bit better on the footprint chart. So first example is the E-Mini S&P 500 This is the 20th of December and we can see this is in the afternoon session and we can see our first little imbalance steps in here. So we're going to do a nice little square there. Imbalance comes in. Now remember what I said, it's all about the relative volume and the delta. So note to pick up in the delta on this rotation. Very high. So we've got a very high imbalance, we even have a zero print. Okay, now when you get two imbalances, obviously it speaks for itself. It's even more regressive. Okay, so we've got the high volume and we've got the high delta and more importantly the high cumulative delta. Now, when we see this imbalance, okay, we need to know which context it is, where we're trading, balanced imbalance market, high or low volume. Now this is a high volume imbalance, so the first thing we're looking to do is trade once we get the absorption on the retest of the imbalance. So we can see we get the absorption, 1671, it ticks one tick lower, as soon as it goes bid we want to be looking to be a buyer. Now obviously in this example we can see that the market does extend to the high.

In terms of stop it's very simple we would have placed the stop there and we would have looked to try and buy again in our second imbalance zone. Okay obviously the market held this imbalance zone and kept holding it and holding it whilst rotating. Okay so that's our first example of an imbalance type strategy. So this example now is a little bit different Again volume may be a little bit lighter. How do we know that? Well, look at the colors guys. Look at the relative color Okay. So what we can see is obviously the market creates an imbalance Okay, high volume high Delta. Okay, so really relatively efficient Or as we said a high volume imbalance. Therefore, we are looking for the first retest note. We're looking for the absorption Okay, what do we see absorption now again as I always say to you in terms of tips You need to know what high absorption is. Okay, 41 contracts in the gold 29 contracts 32 is not absorption Okay, 114 that is absorption. Okay, once it took that absorption note the reaction Okay, and even a little extension, but obviously look what happens once we come back Okay, note this time we get more absorption. I raise that so we get more absorption Before what happens before we get a little push to the other side. What does it come and test? The other side of the imbalance and we ultimately then get the fill-out process beginning Okay, so the second example We would have been a buyer there looking for obviously a cut and reverse Somewhere around one of these two prices We have cut and reverse and traded it back towards the lower end of the imbalance, which is somewhere around there Okay, we can see that the market really gave us all three. It gave us the sell on the absorption. What was quite nice as well is, again I always talk about clues, but note the imbalance here once that absorption occurred. Okay, so we got the absorption, bang, straight away we get the imbalance 232, 4185, 61185. We got quite a strong imbalance. Okay, so another really good example of a high volume in balance and again guys you don't have to You have to think a great deal I mean, I know sometimes it's difficult to keep up with all the metrics of what's high volume. What's low volume? What's absorption, but that's what the footprint tools for it's got the colors Okay, so we can see dark blue shows us high relative volume.

Okay, and that's our full example then of what the auction imbalance looks like. So this example again, this is now in the German Buns, like I said, my favourite market. I'm going to show you what a low volume imbalance looks like now. So this is where the imbalance occurs. Notice 14.265, 26.370, 1.65, 0.309, 3.44, 8.45. We will talk about this in exhaustion highs and lows. When you do get an imbalance at an extreme point, the market does tend to back off and relax a little bit. Note the relative volume. Okay, a really really low low volume imbalance here hence We're looking for a short side trade, again, looking to, oh, sorry, let me go back one step. In this example, we're not going to be looking for a first time buy, okay, so we're not interested in the first part of it. If anything, this is one you either want to leave alone or, like I said, you could be willing to be a buyer, look for the buy, look for a little bit of rotation and Okay, so that's an example of what a low volume imbalance will look like as well as obviously the outcome now the last example Again, this is an oil market and what we can see a little bit of stopout actually taking place and again interesting That the same amount of contracts one one six one one six But we can see the imbalance kind of starts over here. In fact, it actually starts a bit lower so we can see the imbalance starting little bit lower and we can see that imbalance going all the way up to somewhere around here now. I did mention to you obviously you can use rotational charts as well as time based charts and you will still see these imbalances again remember they're going to be as shown with or most likely it could be dark colors or light colors if they're darker colors we know it's quite a high volume imbalance if they are lighter colors we know it's quite a low volume imbalance but do recognize I mean you can sort of looking over this. What I will say, if you don't have the imbalance chart, you'll normally see it with a shift invariant. So if you ever see a shift invariant or volatility in the market, a greater number of prices over which the market is trading, have a look up, there's most likely going to be some form of imbalance.

We look to be a buyer, we target the extreme, note once it comes back below that point, we can see, look at the absorption taking place, so quite a lot of absorption before it filters down lower and ultimately the market begins the process of filling out. So that's the three-step process of trading an auction in balance. Now, let's go look at two practical examples I'm going to go through these with you. The first one is the e-mini S&P again I'm going to show you this on on the traditional Imbalance footprint chart so you can see it quite clearly Note obviously on the footprint in balance chart. You can see the colors where the imbalances occur So you'd be looking for three or four of those We obviously can see a little bit of an imbalance occurring here on the left side. That is our imbalance ultimately, and so that's what's got us now interested. We've got one imbalance, two imbalances, three imbalances within the market, maybe even four there. So a real strong imbalance. Note it is a high volume imbalance as well as a high delta imbalance. So we're looking for that first little pullback into the imbalance area. did the absorption. It didn't quite give us the perfect price point. It kind of absorbed quite a lot around this $5.74 before taking off, taking off, taking off. But if you fast forward it we'll see what happens. Ultimately the market continues in the same vein in the direction and keeps defending the imbalance and what we're interested in is when suddenly the imbalance is now complete and the market chooses to go in the opposite direction. So note the first thing obviously A little bit of an imbalance in the 35s, 329 trade down, straight away onto the 34.5s. What we're looking for now is a short side trade to fill out the imbalance down to the 33. So note again, well there's the imbalance, another potential imbalance, no real buying through the market, another imbalance, another imbalance. So an imbalance in the opposite direction confirms the short side trade, we're looking for profits in and around this 33, and we're looking to cut in reverse and fill Okay, so you can see obviously the markets begins the process of absorbing as soon as we see that absorption Okay, we know that there's a buyer stepping in holding the market and obviously once the buying or once the selling is done the market then turns back around goes back bird and Ultimately the market then begins to fill out the process of filling in the auction Okay, I'm just going to show you this how it fills out and so important guys with these auction imbalances, you know it can take some time but the whole point of an imbalance is that it can spend a lot of time filling", "transcript": "in the market, a greater number of prices over which the market is trading, have a look up, there's most likely going to be some form of imbalance.

So an imbalance in the opposite direction confirms the short side trade, we're looking for profits in and around this 33, and we're looking to cut in reverse and fill Okay, so you can see obviously the markets begins the process of absorbing as soon as we see that absorption Okay, we know that there's a buyer stepping in holding the market and obviously once the buying or once the selling is done the market then turns back around goes back bird and Ultimately the market then begins to fill out the process of filling in the auction Okay, I'm just going to show you this how it fills out and so important guys with these auction imbalances, you know it can take some time but the whole point of an imbalance is that it can spend a lot of time filling", "ocr_text": null, "visual_caption": null, "metadata": {"chunk_idx": 16, "frame_refs": ["output/UNIT_9___Strategy_4_Auction_Imbalances_1-6/frames/scene_0002_end.jpg", "output/UNIT_9___Strategy_4_Auction_Imbalances_1-6/frames/scene_0003_start.jpg", "output/UNIT_9___Strategy_4_Auction_Imbalances_1-6/frames/scene_0003_mid.jpg", "output/UNIT_9___Strategy_4_Auction_Imbalances_1-6/frames/scene_0003_end.jpg", "output/UNIT_9___Strategy_4_Auction_Imbalances_1-6/frames/scene_0004_start.jpg", "output/UNIT_9___Strategy_4_Auction_Imbalances_1-6/frames/scene_0004_mid.jpg"]}}

Okay, so that's our first example and now a second example and the last one for this strategy session is the gold This is obviously a time based gold footprint chart do bear in mind. Obviously. This is no longer an imbalance one But as I mentioned to note the volatility okay, so we can see average prices are about seven prices That's the average rotation if suddenly that shifts to 14 or 20. We know there's a high probability for some form of an imbalance So let's have a look now So we can see the market is trading at these lows, and suddenly it takes off, get aggressive initiative coming in, we've got one imbalance, we've got two imbalances. So very similar to the SPU's example, we've got two imbalances, note this is no fundamental news or anything, it's just simply a very volatile market. Again note, the volatility pick up, that means there is potential for an imbalance. Now what we're looking for is a retest ahead of the imbalances, somewhere around 67.3 so let's fast-forward this a little bit so the market comes after extending all the way up comes all the way back Notice where it stops okay stops there and what we said we're looking for the absorption That's our clue we get the absorption. We're looking to be a buyer of the next price Okay, but this time that's what the market does okay, so we get the absorption but all of a sudden the market goes through the first imbalance. Now remember what I said to you, we have to keep a tight stop. Why? Because if we fill out or we remove or get through that first bit of absorption, the market is likely to continue low and fill out the imbalance. Okay, so keep the stop tight equally. Don't be afraid to cut and reverse there short and then get long for the bounce back up. Okay, obviously we do have the second imbalance then. Again, note how the market comes down to it. A little bit of absorption beforehand Okay, that's the process of our fast forwarders.
