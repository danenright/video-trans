There are four main sections, the first one being the beginner, then the intermediate section, the advanced, and then the knowledge set. So now we'll be discussing each one. Now, the beginner section, we've already gone through the first two modules. And the next module will be module four. We'll be looking at what the ladders tell you that the charts do not. Then we shift really gears, we start looking at the intermediate level. And we begin by looking at the various market participants, the algorithms, and the high-frequency trading systems. We look at probably my favorite module. in the entire out of all the entire module because it's effectively the foundation for understanding price ladder patterns and that is understanding auctioning exchange and market velocity and really what that looks like it's all well defining it but what does it really look like and we'll be looking at a couple of a really key ladder videos to really make you understand and accelerate that those pattern recognition skills in your Within your mental framework and building a really strong foundation and a methodology That's that is really the the basis for understanding all the other order flow patterns that we look at So that's really key in module 6. There's anything for you to take out from all of these modules I really want the focus and the intensity to be there module 6 and then we start and then ready from module 7 We we really start digging down into the various order flow patterns So it's a brief introduction into all the various different order flow patterns that we look at and the various trading strategies And then we start shifting at the specific order flow strategies such as the large order book events Various and then we go into module 9, looking at the various absorption order flow events and the variety that do exist and then how do you trade in and around them. Then we go and move over to module 10, observing market flipping patterns and spoofing price patterns and what appropriate trading strategies that you do deploy to effectively profit from them. where effectively we'll be looking at a myriad of order flow patterns that we looked in module 8 to 10 and we combine them in order to work out when in this instance module level when there's a potential trend reversal that's in play or in module 12 when we when we have these expansive plays on the order flow when the market moves from compression to an expansive state and then module 13 again we look at a confluence", "transcript": "Now, let's discuss the roadmap to success and how we're dividing up all the key modules.
