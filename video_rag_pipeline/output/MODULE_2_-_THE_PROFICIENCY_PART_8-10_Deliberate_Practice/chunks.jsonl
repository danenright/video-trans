We're going to talk a little bit about deliberate practice. I absolutely love golf and the reason is that golf has got so many similarities to that of a trader and one of the key things that if anyone knows a golfer is how hard and deliberately they practice their game. These guys can spend hours standing over a three foot putt and they can hit the same All just for muscle memory, all for repetition, repetition, repetition, to build confidence, to build trust in what they're trying to do. I find too many traders, they have brilliant minds and brilliant understanding, but they just don't practice enough, whether it's practicing their skill set, whether it's practicing the strategies that they develop, they just don't practice enough. So what we're going to talk about is deliberate practice and why it's so crucial becoming a trader. So, why do we have an exact process to view the markets? Why do we want to every day view the markets through the same lens? Well, it's very simple. Firstly, it allows us to benchmark. By looking at the market through the same template every day, we're going to learn to almost identify and pick up on certain changes and pick up when we're deviating from the plan and when we're not sticking to the plan. Next, pattern recognition. So again, if we use the same template every day, we're going to start picking up and identifying various patterns that play out in the market and what patterns are working and what patterns are not working. And again, pattern recognition Routine discipline and precision guys if we deliberately practice every day or have a template every day or you know Arrive at the same time every day we developing routine we developing discipline And we developing precision and these are all key elements to not just developing edge You know not just developing or becoming a successful trader But to becoming successful at any endeavor whether it's golf or trading So, what are some of the deliberate practice methods you could utilize? Well firstly, playback functionality. I will show you a little bit more about this playback functionality in Module 3, but what we're basically going to do there is we're going to playback how a volume profile develops over time. And what you'll learn to do with this is you'll learn to not just pick up on key early observations, but you'll then learn to trade and exit and enter as a whilst not risking any capital and again this is going to install confidence and trust in some of the patterns that I'm developing with you as well as some of the strategies you will develop over time.", "transcript": "Welcome to the final stages of Module 2, Part 8.

Then, looking at patterns in isolation, also known as backtesting. So it's crucial that when you do identify one pattern, don't just keep that one pattern. Go find as many observations of that pattern as possible, break it down into its basic elements and learn all about the different variations of how that pattern could potentially And then, we want to put the patterns across various trade locations. So again, we test these patterns, we deliberately put them in different situations so as to see how they respond in different conditions, different trade locations, different contexts. Doing this again will help us to master the pattern in various conditions so that when times become a little bit tougher and a little bit different, it's not new to us but it's merely something we've seen before. And then lastly, back testing over time within various conditions as we've mentioned before.
