Now what we're going to talk about firstly is high volume areas. So the basic principles of high volume areas is that they are balanced regions, so they Note, the activity of trade that's taking place in these high volume areas is basically trade facilitation between buyers and sellers. So remember, it's all good and well seeing a high volume area on a chart, but what does it actually mean? Well, in essence, it means buyers and sellers are accepting a series of prices until new So fair value is being established by buyers and sellers and more importantly we have both buyers and sellers present. Now again remember these principles you have to apply to the time frame in which you are looking at the market. If you're looking at a market on a week-to-week or a monthly basis and you are seeing a little bit of two-way trade or fair value being accepted this may be in a trend where we're having a current pause. It could be where the market's been moving sideways for a couple of months. So make sure you apply these principles and this understanding to whichever time frame you're trying to interpret it in. Now some of the observations when it comes to high volume areas. Firstly, a high volume area attracts price in the short term. So once a market has accepted an area as a fair value, it does tend to attract prices constantly over a period of time. So at some point at a future date, we should come and retest that high volume or accepted fair value. Now, markets have a strong tendency to retest high volume areas. Now again, this is not a hard fast rule, this is not an exact rule. What I'm trying to get across here is that when you look at a high volume area, when you see it on your volume profiles, what does it mean to you? More importantly, if you go back and you look every time the market develops a high This is the objective. I'm going to teach you the principles and the understanding. You need to go and develop the potential strategy. Now, markets have a relatively short-term memory for high-volume areas. In other words, what they can tend to do is they might not respect the high-volume area when they come back and test it. In fact, they may actually go straight through it. Now, high-volume attracts price but it is not a rigid floor or ceiling. Okay, so what we mean by that is if a market moves away from fair value and then comes back to retest it as it often does, it doesn't imply this high volume error is support or", "transcript": "As promised back in module 2, I said we would discuss high volume areas and low volume areas in a far more in-depth discussion.

Okay, so what we mean by that is if a market moves away from fair value and then comes back to retest it as it often does, it doesn't imply this high volume error is support or resistance or that it will hold as a potential respective level. It is merely a reference point. It is a reference where buyers and sellers previously accepted prices as fair value. don't try to be perfect, rather place belief in the principle. In other words, you cannot develop an exact strategy. A high volume area is merely telling you about the interaction between buyers and selling. It's telling you about the potential future interaction of buyers and sellers. Okay, and that is the core concept is to understand what does a high volume area mean principally and what can it aid in terms of your various trade strategies that I'm going to develop with you and you're going to develop yourself.

When a market does tend to come back to a previous high value era, it does tend to slow trade up a little bit. We do tend to find that because traders or because strategies that are developed... tend to trade back towards these high value areas, once previous value is being accepted again we tend to see a little bit of profit taking and two-way trade. So it's very often that a previous value area does slow trade up a bit, so if you do happen to be in a wrong trade or a bad trade, this is the kind of area that could just give you a little bit of time to get out of a sticky or a bad position.", "transcript": "In fact, they may actually go straight through it.
