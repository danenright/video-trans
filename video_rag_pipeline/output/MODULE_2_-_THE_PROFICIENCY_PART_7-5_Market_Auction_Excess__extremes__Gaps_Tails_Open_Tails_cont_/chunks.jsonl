As you can see, the previous day the market closed toward the lower end of the range and the next day we completely gapped away from where, not just value, but where the range of the day was. Now, again, remember this is an out of balance type open, it's a form of market excess and the reason we discuss it is because when we have these excesses in the market, it brings other time frame players into the market, it forces them to respond and trade gives us a lot of opportunity to take advantage. Now the invisible tail as discussed is where we have a very aggressive initiative but within the day's established range. Now you can see this invisible tail if you look at the second TPO which is the L print and then the very next print which is the M print. both of those second and third TPO prints would be an invisible tail. The reason is because the market very quickly auctioned away from lower prices, but because it was done within the already established range, it might not have appeared as just a traditional tail where we have single prints. And then in the last example we have a market open tail, as you can see the market opens towards the lower bound and very quickly the market navigates higher, a nice confident up move in prices as we see initiative from the open. So those are the three types of excess that you're likely to see in volume profiling.", "transcript": "So, the first of the three examples would be the price gap.
