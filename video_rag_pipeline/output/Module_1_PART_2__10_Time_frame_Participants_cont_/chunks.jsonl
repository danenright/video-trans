First and foremost it's important to understand that whilst we've identified these five participants individually to try and understand them and understand the characteristics of each time frame participant, it's important to understand that at any given moment in any given market Now, this will complicate the process altogether, however, when we go through the various strategies, I'm going to show you how to break down and understand which time frame participant is responding in each strategy. Then, most important to understand with regards to time frame participants, who is in control? If it's the paper longer term institution in control, we do not want to fade that, We actually want to develop strategies to go with that. However, if it's the shorter term timeframes that are in control and they're just moving the market in between ranges, then that kind of a market we can look to either go with or fade. So it's important to understand who is in control at which time. Note, trading requires a great deal of mental flexibilities. Traders who integrate discipline, emotional control and agile market understanding are generally able to let go of prior patterns that are no longer working. It's so important to understand that when developing trading strategies with the various time frames, because sometimes the strategies are just not going to work. And we have to accept this. More importantly, we have to be willing to be nimble and flexible so as to adjust To be successful, investors must recognize the confluence of evolving factors that will eventually lead to a changing market atmosphere. Very simply what this means. Change is occurring all the time. We need to make sure that we can recognize this change, recognize what is making these changes in the market and recognize how we can change in order to take advantage of this change. To know the right context is much. To know the right spot is everything. Hugo von Hommenstahl. To summarise, the markets are constantly changing.
