And as these players video, I'll run you guys through where my target is and how, you know, I also, I execute well, but then my management isn't as good, but we'll get into that as the video plays on. So let me start us up for you guys. So, like I said, this is just after Cash Open. We have this level here at 74, which is really important. And what I want you guys to notice is just look at these offers here that we've got sitting just around this 74, 70 areas. We've got these large offers and I want you guys to pay attention to how we trade, as we're watching market and what's trading at market, but how we trade through these offers and what actually goes through and This guy is spoofing it up, lifting it up, you know, on nothing, on thin air, and then how he pulls it back down. So notice market, there's no real initiative buying going on, small clips coming through, five lots, two lots, no sort of, anything that's being clipped down, it's not solid size, which is then being, you know, lifted back up. It's just two-way trade, it's just sort of low-volume, two-way trade, there's nothing really to gauge at the moment. Just watch as we sort of, as we rotate, as we keep rotating up here towards 74s. Just pay attention to see how we just got clipped there 128 lots traded for its 70s and again watch pay attention to the 72s Now and how we react it. He hasn't he hasn't moved. He's still there He um same as the rest of the size notice all the size still here on the offer Still it looks thick right it looks it looks like you know It's genuine size wanting to be filled to keep you know pay attention and keep paying attention to how how uh... we trade through here and you know you know this will mean that the sort of telltale side you see they see how we just got clipped down on small size you know there's nothing there's no genuine sort of stagger in the bid there's no sort of progressive levels being held and respected it's it's just kind of washing back whenever you know any sort of side steps in and clips down like i said guys just pay attention to when we start trading up through here they notice that i'm really looking was trading for a market right now When the clip size has changed into when you know that when the bid starts to firm up again You see we just traded 70s out without even seeing what went for a market clipped You know the size is going through here 71s, but it's still sort of it's sticking It's it's just if we're still just accumulating size in this area. No real intent to lift prices now We're seeing 72 straight out you see You know only a hundred or lots traded through there and the guys pulled his offer.

So this is the offer, the offer block we're looking at, and notice now some size going through on the bid, yeah, clipping down, you know, 420 lots trading through here, notice the reload, and then we've clipped through, right? So now you've seen the 74s trade out, we didn't really see what traded through. I have 173 lots trading here at 76, and now you can just see how we start to rotate, right? Notice how the offer gets a bit heavy, 74 has just absorbed 400 lots and clipped back down. The size has traded in here and smacked back down.

Is there going to be two-way trade between here or are we going to roll back down and come back more down to accepted value? But like I said guys, I'm just going to fast forward this slightly. So now The offer block I want to just fast forward slightly If I can get the right So basically, let me just rewind a bit for you guys. Okay, so I am going to go just a tad further forward Right.

Just notice the bid being pulled here, sorry, the offer being pulled, and these guys still flipping up here.

This whole move up here, like I was sort of saying, and how I kind of go about all my trading is understanding where, you know, you need to understand where is the People you know going from passive to initiative buying in terms of you understanding where people are absorbing and then stepping up Because people you know, where is they're accepted? You know someone's trying to get filled and then he's going to you know, make it more aggressive or is he or where is he now?

You need to sort of just You need to see it for what it is in terms of structure, so i.e. your charts, your profile, all that sort of stuff, and then you just need to... don't get necessarily so caught up in this. Whereas, you know, for myself, I identified a great level in terms of, you know, 74s. You know, I've seen that there's a series of 74s.

That bid that you saw up earlier through the sort of as we start bidding up through 68 69 This area it was just this was just all sort of up or nothing on thin air And as you just see without this is where you see the pulling now in the bids You just see that this is that straight line offer I'm talking about in terms of when it goes it just there's there's no sort of Anyone who's buying this move down is just paying up paying up low ticks and as you and if you do start You know you need to kind of this is with the bund in general. I'll be fine. You need to sort of just You need to see it for what it is in terms of structure, so i.e. your charts, your profile, all that sort of stuff, and then you just need to... don't get necessarily so caught up in this. Whereas, you know, for myself, I identified a great level in terms of, you know, 74s. You know, I've seen that there's a series of 74s.

This is really hard sort of flip price action You need to sort of you know You've got your risk, you know, you're where your risk stops above this high, you know, it stops above the Area you've worked in the area of exhaustion you've seen It's all just about you know, let the bun do its thing.

Don't get me wrong guys, a number of times I've been getting long on this bid, trying to really dissect the price, really trying to understand it, when in reality it's and then when you're buying on the way down sort of thing like that as well then you're sort of paying up and you're and you're really um and you're really doing damage you know i mean especially early on in the day like this guys it can be a real um it can be it can be real sort of psychological damage in terms of and more energy sort of you know i mean um just preserving energy understanding the smaller trades understand like these little trades like this guys you know don't try and you don't have to um read too much into the ladder because I'm better off in terms of just understanding a setup.
