Okay, now what I want to talk about here is why and how to use different time frame rotations, how to choose rotations, some time based or how to know whether you use time based or not, what styles to use and etc etc. So I'm going to go through this one by one with you on the chart now and hopefully you'll get a better idea. Okay, so what do we mean by that? Well, in Unit 2, I discussed with you that when we go and we modify the footprint, we've obviously got, in terms of the source, we can choose between a number of different source types. Now, note throughout this course, I'm only ever going to use two. types, one is a bar, one is a point and figure, not because the others aren't potentially good options, but because this is where I've developed experience and skill over time, I feel I can organize the information in a really good way just utilizing these two. Now bear in mind guys, you can go through the different options here, what I would say is that the minute you start to go through these options, just make sure that the Okay, so the first two obviously is why and how to use the different time frame rotations. So the first obviously we spoke about, we had a bar which is a time based, whereas a point and figure is a rotation based. In other words, the market will only create a rotation once it meets a certain criteria. Okay, so now once you've chosen your source type, then we need to look at obviously the types of styles. Within each, within the point and figure and the bar, you can select any one of these five styles. Now again, throughout this course, I'm only going to spend time talking bid and ask as well as the imbalance. And the reason I explained to you in unit two is very simple. Things like volume and delta, you can get that same information utilizing both these styles of bid and ask and imbalance. As for the profile, again I don't need that style yet, why? Because I have both a profile tool added, which I'll show you how to do in a minute, as well as obviously I have a tool added, but also you don't need this in terms of making decisions based on the footprint. Okay, so that's where we're going to start now. Just again, I've made a note here, just remember guys, a tool is there to extract information based on the strategy you wish to execute. So what that means is that, like I said to you with these color lines, we've identified a potential breakout strategy around the $58.61.

Okay, now let's quickly go and apply some of this to the tool. So what we've got over here is an oil. Now if you want to apply a rotation, a 10 tick rotation to the oil, we're simply going to right click on the tool, modify the footprint, check that our source is Now, once we've got that point and figure as our source type, you simply want to click and choose on the reversal, that's ultimately your rotation. Okay, so note, we said for oil, we want to use 10 ticks simply because it's equivalent to one dollar, and we then just going to simply go and push okay, okay? And you'll see now what will happen is, the oil will only create a new rotation once Okay, so we can see, obviously this morning, based on this current rotation, we've had quite a long rotation, this rotation started, as you see if you hover over, this rotation started at 10 o'clock this morning, and it's now simply been going on for almost a good 48 minutes. Okay, now, where rotations are very, very effective, and again, we'll talk a lot for flows or when there's a general auction in the market, the markets are trending in what direction, that's when I would tend to focus a little bit more on rotations. In fact, before we move on, let me just bring up the next, this whole sort of discussion that we're going to have now. So this is what I'm talking about is how do we know when to use time based or when There is no right or wrong, it all just depends on the strategy. Okay, remember what I said to you right at the beginning. You don't want to utilize the tool to make decisions. You ultimately want to have a strategy in mind, whether it's a breakout, a fade, an extreme high and extreme low, and you want to utilize the tool to extract the information that will allow you to execute the strategy effectively. Okay, so for me I use both and as you'll see when we go through the 10 strategies, you're going to see me interchange between the two and give you understanding as to why one is better for that strategy than the other. Okay, but what it comes down to in simple terms is, some examples, if I'm looking Okay, so like I showed you that oil, I want to see where the real pocket positioning is, you know what the delta's looking like on the day-to-day.", "transcript": "the best bid and the best offer, or there's a lot of untraded prices, just having maybe a 5 minute or maybe having a 10 tick or a 20 tick rotation, it won't show you any Okay, so in those instances, again, maybe you want to use say a 20 tick rotation in the DAX or maybe in the Bitcoin, maybe a $50 rotation just so that you can pick up on the information being shown. Okay, now let's quickly go and apply some of this to the tool. So what we've got over here is an oil. Now if you want to apply a rotation, a 10 tick rotation to the oil, we're simply going to right click on the tool, modify the footprint, check that our source is Now, once we've got that point and figure as our source type, you simply want to click and choose on the reversal, that's ultimately your rotation. Okay, so note, we said for oil, we want to use 10 ticks simply because it's equivalent to one dollar, and we then just going to simply go and push okay, okay? And you'll see now what will happen is, the oil will only create a new rotation once Okay, so we can see, obviously this morning, based on this current rotation, we've had quite a long rotation, this rotation started, as you see if you hover over, this rotation started at 10 o'clock this morning, and it's now simply been going on for almost a good 48 minutes. Okay, now, where rotations are very, very effective, and again, we'll talk a lot for flows or when there's a general auction in the market, the markets are trending in what direction, that's when I would tend to focus a little bit more on rotations. In fact, before we move on, let me just bring up the next, this whole sort of discussion that we're going to have now. So this is what I'm talking about is how do we know when to use time based or when There is no right or wrong, it all just depends on the strategy. Okay, remember what I said to you right at the beginning. You don't want to utilize the tool to make decisions. You ultimately want to have a strategy in mind, whether it's a breakout, a fade, an extreme high and extreme low, and you want to utilize the tool to extract the information that will allow you to execute the strategy effectively. Okay, so for me I use both and as you'll see when we go through the 10 strategies, you're going to see me interchange between the two and give you understanding as to why one is better for that strategy than the other.

What I'm then going to do is I'd far rather use a time-based, okay, so like I showed you, I'd get up a bar and simply make it a time-based. Okay, if I'm a swing trader maybe, I might have a bar but maybe use 30-minute or 60-minute time-based. Alright, when I'm trading things like central banks, so macro events, central I'd prefer to use a bar, however this time it's going to be a shorter time base, so it's going to be maybe a one minute or a five minute bar time frame. Then in terms of a strategy of breakouts or maybe the cash open of markets, I always prefer to use rotations. Why? Because that's when we tend to see initiative or fast money or flow or trend in the market. And then obviously in terms of swing trading, again if there's a good trend in the market and you're a trend follower, rotations will be better. Obviously if you're maybe a daily trader, a daily swing trading, you might argue that 30 or 60 minute time frame rotations are better. So it all depends guys.

The one main advantage and disadvantage of the two, it's very simple. In a time-based rotation, as you can see, you've got a relative understanding. What do I mean by that? You know that every one of these bars is equivalent, you're comparing apples to apples. So you can say, in this instance, all the apples were equal, they were really balanced here, the market was struggling to move. We then suddenly had a break, and on this apple, what you would have noticed is maybe there was an increase in volume, increase in volatility relative to the previous bars. Okay, so time allows us to compare things on a relative basis far better than on That's the major advantage of time-based. The major disadvantage of time-based, which happens to be the major advantage of rotation-based, is that a lot of the time, a time-based doesn't show the auctioning or the trending as well. In other words, what we can see, if I flick between this and I go and I say modify, and we move this to maybe say a time-based again, what you'll notice is that we can't Okay, all we see is maybe a lot of noise, it shows us a lot more information, you know if I was to zoom this out maybe and put it in a little bit of a longer time frame, okay again we can still see you know kind of a lot of rotation but if we go and compare", "transcript": "is better for that strategy than the other.

So it's a very effective way of highlighting real big shifts. You can play around with this, obviously you can create all sorts of highlighters on the left.

An imbalance is nothing more than a footprint where whenever there is a significant difference between the diagonal, it's no longer horizontal, it's now diagonal. So in an up move whenever there's a really big difference between what the buyer bought an imbalance. And we can see these imbalances highlighted in the red on the left and the green numbers on the right. Now, what does it mean? Well, it's simple. An imbalance simply means, as I explained to you in Unit 3, it's where there is quite a significant shift in the interaction between the buyer and seller because we're shifting from prices. As we move up, prices are shifting and the interaction is shifting. So we can now set, with the footprint tool, we can set what that shift should look like. And that's what we're going to do now. We're going to go and play around with all these options on your imbalance. Now the first thing to talk about is this button here called the threshold. So what a threshold is, is it's a way to eliminate a lot of the smaller traded volume In other words, if I don't want to see low volume imbalances, i.e. imbalances created maybe by algorithms, I can set the marker to only show me when there is volume above 50 lots. So as soon as I push apply, you'll see effectively we almost lose all of our information. So let's try and maybe make that five instead. And we can see that there's a lot of zeros now. Now, in other words, obviously where there are zeroes, the volume was lower than the five. Okay, so what I would suggest, again, stick to the threshold of zero, but that's what the tool effectively does, it ultimately just reduces the amount of information you can see. Now, in terms of the imbalance, this is the percentage of imbalance in order to show either red on the sell side or green on the buy side. If I make it simple, I'm going to make it 400%, which means four times as much volume. Okay, what happens is in this example we can see that there was four times more volume bought than sold. Okay, so obviously 19 times 4 is 76. So we can see that there was four times as much or more than four times and therefore it's created an imbalance. Okay, likewise to the sell side, we can see obviously there was 88 sold versus 10 bought. That's roughly 8 times, therefore because it's more than 400%, it creates an imbalance. Okay, again we can see obviously it's done the same thing in this instance. Okay, now again just to point out, that imbalance I would suggest as a rule of thumb, keep that imbalance between I would say maybe 200%, don't go less than 200%, but equally don't", "transcript": "it again in detail.

Okay, then the last one is obviously this minimum difference. All this is showing and again, this is why I prefer to keep the threshold zero. If you do want to eliminate some of the noise or some of the imbalances created by algorithms, this is where you can select a minimum difference between the diagonal prices. Whenever there is a less than 50 contract difference between the two, it's not going to show me the imbalance.

Because the difference between 10 and 88, 78, which means the minimum difference threshold is not met. So again, that's a way to eliminate some of the imbalances created by small orders.

In terms of obviously the redistribute, you'll have, sorry bear with me for a sec, so in terms of okay, what we found here is you've got a whole bunch of functions here, you can shade obviously some of the reverse shading just instead of having red for more selling, oh sorry, instead of having a lot of delta in a darker shade you can flip it around and say when there's a lot of delta whether it's negative or positive, make it the So that's all the reverse shading is. In terms of the dominant, again this is a really good function if you want to, if you're a bit more of a flow trader and you only trade directional trend, what this will show you, it will only show you the footprint shading in terms of the direction that the market's going in. Okay so again you can play with those options, for me what I would suggest is keep it nice and simple. Okay, if you do update this and you get the latest version of the Footprint tool, you'll notice they do have obviously a regroup or a rescale and the rescale is just simply an auto-scale so when you are moving around the tool will auto-scale with you as you move around which is quite handy and can come in handy for you. Okay, now before we finish off, that's pretty much a wrap of the tool, it really just shows you the intricacies of the tool, some of the things you can do, some of the conditioning and the formatting. But where I want to kind of finish is with just one more little picture that I'm going to show you, is effectively that, still not sure. Alright, you've got so many options guys, as you've seen you can hover over things, you can hover over any of the functionality and it will give you an understanding of what the tool or what that information is. If you're still not sure, you've got the infoboxes, so you can utilize those infoboxes", "transcript": "just simply, remember the shades is an algorithm that is designed to give, to allocate a shade based on the relative difference between the deltas. If you wanted a lot of relative differences you can select 14 shades or 16 shades or 18 shades. For me I would stick to either a minimum of 4 shades, in other words you will only have 2 blue shades and 2 red shades, or I would stick to a maximum of 8 shades where you have 4 red shades and 4 blue shades. Anything more, again you've got a question or you may be over complicating it. But that option does exist for you. Then obviously sometimes we do want to add a candlestick, just a traditional candlestick bar on the left side of the footprint so we can see the open, the closed, the high and the low. To do that we simply just select the size of it, we can make it nice and big too, and we'll see obviously that candlestick pops up on the left side.
