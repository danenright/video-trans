So what is the difference between the two? Well subjective or subjectivity is influenced or Feelings or opinions or intuitive or instinctive? It's this opinion we have about something having to occur because we feel it should Now, where do these subjective ideas come from? Well, first and foremost they come from very big fundamentals, whether that's data that moves the markets, whether that's companies producing new products, or whether that's a new big thing, a new big trend in the market. All these sorts of fundamentals give us these ideas, these opinions or this instinct that something should go up or down. Subjectivity also comes from CNBC and Bloomberg and analysts. Why? Because well we see these high-profile individuals on the TV and and writing articles in the newspapers and we think well because they're experts and all of a sudden we put ourselves in these subjective ideas or in the subjective mindset that something should occur because someone high profile said it. Then, most important, subjective is because of opinions, the opinions of your peers, of other traders, of what other people think, of people on Twitter, right? All these things together put us into a subjective mindset Now, what's the counter to that? What's the opposite to that? It's objective. Okay? Objective is not influenced. It's factual based. It's unbiased. It's neutral. Fair-minded, open-minded, impersonal and unemotional. As we can see, it's the complete opposite of subjective. It's fact-based. It's exact. There's no idea or opinion about it. So, where does objectivity come from? Well, we can get objectivity from volume market profiling. We can get objectivity from price action, in other words, what we're physically seeing prices do. We can get objectivity from various trading strategies. If we have a trading strategy where we have exact execution, there's no ifs and buts. There's A and B. So, the question you have to ask yourself is very simple. In every single trade you take, in every single strategy you develop, are you being objective? Every time you click on that mouse, you should be able to say, I'm being objective in this approach, in this process. And is your trading strategy exact? If it isn't exact, guys, you do not have an edge.", "transcript": "This is by far one of the most important principles you're going to learn in part one Objective versus subjective analysis.
