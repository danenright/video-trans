And also, so if we have a look now that the most important part is that the human is still a more powerful operating system than. the algorithmic machine because we have the the sophisticated biological development of intuition and an intuition really can factor in so many multiple types of patterns linking different types of contextual arrangements and this is why we train our traders predominantly exclusively on a discretionary training approach because we believe in the human's ability to observe patterns and profit from them without being at the mercy of a system and a systematic approach that that can break down if it's not learning in real time until we have an artificial intelligence that really understands feeling emotions and understands you know how how how the how the entire body of opportunities is really governed by the emotional state of human beings within the financial marketplace, well then the machine does not quite compete with the operating system that's in between our skill. So, really important to us to understand that HFT systems sit on the exchange so they are co-located which really reduces the distance of financial transactions and so when you're designing your algorithm and you want to compete on speed, you need to ensure that you co-located and with the training technology platform, most of these services are co-located at the key largest exchanges such as Eurex and CME all around the world and the algorithmic is it's a speed race with a world of different strategies. So, you know, the HFT systems are all these algorithms that really is this arm speed race where they're trying to separate themselves really from an effective strategy coupled with the ability to execute incredibly quickly.
