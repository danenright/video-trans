Now what you want to do is you want to go highlight not just today and what we've dealt with but over time all the characteristics that define those who succeed and those who don't succeed. So for example 95% of traders that fail tend to take big losses, 95% of traders that tend to fail also tend to come into the markets every day with some form of a bias. tend to have no edge. Then what we do on the other side is we try and highlight all the key characteristics that define traders that succeed in the industry. Firstly, they tend to have a very strong routine. They tend to follow a very stringent set of rules. They tend to have a very process-orientated approach. And they have a very very strong edge. Now, this is not an exhaustive list. The point of this is that you as a trader, as you go on in your career, as you spend time in the markets, you will pick up very quickly what are the things that cost you money and other traders. Equally, when you find certain characteristics amongst your peers or even within yourself that allow you to succeed as a trader, make sure you highlight them in the reasons for success. That way, over time, you'll very quickly pick up on what characteristics are required to succeed and what are required or what characteristics lead traders to failing. That was the first principle we dealt with. Then we moved on and we started to talk about the advantages of volume profiling.

You need to make sure that you understand this, because... This for me is probably one of the most crucial principles that you need to learn as a trader. Very simply we say that objective is very much fact-based type analysis. It's unbiased. It's unemotional.
