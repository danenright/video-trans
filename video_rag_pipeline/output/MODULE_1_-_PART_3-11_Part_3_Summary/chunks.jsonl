I hope you enjoyed a lot of the principles we went over. As you can see now, we're finally getting to sort of utilize the tool a little bit, start to sort of finally understand what volume profiling looks like and actually we've got a template now in which we can start building our understanding of volume profiling. However, let's just have a little summary, let's go through some of the principles we've dealt with and then you can get on to doing your tests and your quizzes Where we started off with, we spoke about the volume profiling elements, what makes up a volume profile. So the tool, and we said it consists of the open, the close, the high and the low, the initial balance, the value area high and value area low, and then we spoke about the volume pointer control, we spoke about the tails, single prints and last but not least the profile shape. Now it's very important we're going to give you quite a few questions that you can go and practice this but what you need to be able to do before you move on to part 4 and before you begin module any template based on any market and identify every one of these parameters. Now I'll tell you why as traders we, when you start with the profiling tool, why we spend so much time learning to identify every one of these elements. It's so important if, you know, just by doing a basic, what's the high low and the range at the end of the day? So by knowing what the daily range is, is if you, let's say, for 10 days in a row, realize that your market has got, say, a 50 tick range, all of a sudden, let's say you come in one morning and your market does a 100 tick range, or, alternatively, it does, say, 50 ticks in the first hour of trade, so. In the first hour, suddenly, you do 50 ticks when the normal average daily range of the last 10 days has been, say, 50. Straight away, you're going to recognize that difference. That difference, just that little bit of extra understanding, can mean the difference between you making a vital mistake or not, you fading a strong trend or not, you getting out of a good trade or a bad trade or not. That is why we spend so much time on each one of these variables. Okay, when you get to your playbook, you're going to have a few examples and so you will be able to practice, but make sure guys, go into the markets, go utilize your demo account on your TT profiles and make sure you're able to do this time and time and time again.", "transcript": "Welcome to part three summary, guys, and...

What I will say, you will get quicker at it. You will learn to quickly identify all the volume profiling elements. We then moved on and we started to talk about splitting your profile per auction. Now this is crucial and I'll explain to you why we split it. Remember obviously most of what we've done in part 3 is very basic profiling tool, but what you will start to see as we get on towards module 2 and 3 is you can develop very unique specific strategies just based on the individual rotations or auctions within So just to remind you, what is the split? Well, instead of having, for instance, one big distribution as we look at it, that big distribution is made up of lots of different half an hour distributions. So instead of looking at it as one big picture, we open it up so we can see what each one of these distributions looks like. Now some of the reasons or the reasons why Okay, so by opening it up, we can very quickly determine who's in control. If I had a look at this example in the up move, we can see very clearly that buyers are in control. So if we're going to be utilizing, say, a specific strategy where we want to fade, we must recognize that we're fading against the buyers who are in control. Okay, so that's the first reason why we tend to split our auctions. We then spoke about hidden tails. So a lot of the time, a traditional tail, as we spoke, you would find at the extremes of the market, at the high or the low. However, sometimes within a distribution, you can see a hidden tail, an area where market very quickly navigates away from an area. Now, we will talk more about hidden tails within the profile as we move on towards The third reason why we want to split is we can see volatility expanding or contracting. What do I mean by that? So within our basic example here again, let's say the market goes up in this sort of fashion. These are relatively small candles and they are contained well within the previous candle's range. So we can see that's contained in that range, that in that range, that in that range, that in that range. and overlapped all five of the previous candles, we can see the volatility expanding.", "transcript": "Okay, when you get to your playbook, you're going to have a few examples and so you will be able to practice, but make sure guys, go into the markets, go utilize your demo account on your TT profiles and make sure you're able to do this time and time and time again.

So we can see that's contained in that range, that in that range, that in that range, that in that range. and overlapped all five of the previous candles, we can see the volatility expanding. So it went from contracting to suddenly expanding. Now just knowing that again we can develop some very key strategies around this contraction of volatility and expansion of volatility. And then we spoke about price being accepted, so a lot of the time we can see the auctions doing this, and then coming back, and then doing this, and then coming back. And by the time 4pm hits, you look at it and you say to yourself, well it was a relatively balanced day where the market spent the day sort of auctioning up and down and up and down, you don't want to be recognizing that at 4pm, you want to recognize that earlier in the day so you're not spending the day buying highs and selling lows momentum or a lack of initiation at the extremes. And then the last one we spoke about was sort of the overlapping versus one time framing type distribution. Again, another type control factor. So that is why we split the profiles per auction. Do note we will develop some very key strategies by just opening up the profiles as we go along in module 2 and 3. Then we spoke traditional value areas versus the, I like to call them the modern day volume value areas. We went through a few of the advantages. Now I'm just going to go through those advantages briefly. Note when we use volume value areas, we can include all time zones. Don't forget guys, volume effectively shows trade being facilitated. At a certain price, we're going to see varying volume, sometimes the market will take a lot of volume at a certain price and sometimes it will take very little volume at a certain price. And it's this lack of volume or acceptance of volume that tells us how trade is being facilitated at the advertised prices. So that's why we also use the volume barrier. And then obviously we said that the most important is that when we utilize volume as our key, sort of, you know, one of our key pillars in the profile, we can effectively do a relative analysis. Alright, it's very difficult if you're utilizing volume values, it's very difficult to create a relative approach, whereas because you're using volume, you can create a relative approach far easier.

We then finished off part three, and we spoke about our key three proponents of the profile, and we said they include fair value, and last but not least, excess. Now, again, I'm sure most of you understand this, but the best way to explain it is with a volume profile. Okay, so yeah, we have just a typical normal distribution and as you can see, the market spends most of its time within the Now, that middle section is what we would like to call fair value, and fair value is nothing more than where the market accepts price. Buyers and sellers are accepting this area as the fairest price based on all available information. Where prices are quickly rejected from the high, we like to call that premium. The reason we call this discount a premium is because when price is advertised at a certain location, whether it's at the low or the high, because for instance sellers feel this is a very high price, they step in to take advantage of that advertised price and they very quickly sell the market back down in hope of buying it back lower. and we have vice versa the discount prices at the low. An excess price then is where a market tends to move very quickly away from what is even deemed fair value. So let's say for instance this is our fair value over a long period of time and all absolutely crazy and and stop accepting you know any kind of fair value and we get this excess we get this you know markets lost the plot and we start to trade beyond prices that are regarded as a premium when we do go beyond a point where you know the markets become a bit illogical we start to talk about excess the important thing to understand about excess is that it's not so much you want to be selling this on the way up But what you want to note is that when a market finds an excess point, when it finally does turn around", "transcript": "we can effectively do a relative analysis.
