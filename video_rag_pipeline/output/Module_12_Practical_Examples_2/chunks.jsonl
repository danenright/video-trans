So from congestion to expansion So that's what you're looking for. You're looking for those zones where the market, where the stops could be located and you want to ride with those stops as you exit. Now your trading strategy that you're looking at, you're looking at putting in, so over here on this trade we're actually looking for a stop below this level. around over here. Ideally what you do it is located just below the level so it depends what type of stop-hunting approach you want but you'd normally locate it just below the level. In this instance as you'll see as I start playing the video the stop water was just placed above it because there was actually a smaller time frame pattern over here and we thought that it might front run the stops before the 1-3-3-5-3. Now as you enter your stop your cell your sell order, so it's a passive stop limit or a stop limit sell order. You then want to distribute your bids along the page, so you can distribute you know anything between 15 to 40 ticks all along the page depending how big the congested pattern is or how the length of time, the greater the length of time of the congestion, the greater the potential stop especially in these, especially in the less liquid and more volatile markets. strategy there's a number of different execution strategies trading strategies but mainly what you want to do is ensure is ensure that you have a stop limit or a stop market but you want to be filled in a reasonable area and then you either Exit at market the moment that stops being filled or you have some passive bids lining up ready to you to exit immediately or you can have an OCO where the moment you filled it automatically puts an order on the Romantically puts an order on the on the bid or an order on the offer so you can exit But sometimes that's a little bit slow So a lot of people prefer having passive bids now the ideal ladder market environment you want to have an environment stops it's not approaching it from a great distance you know if it's approaching it quickly from about 60 ticks it might not quite penetrate through you want the market to potentially hovering nearby the level for a little bit of time before it stops through the liquidity conditions don't have to be you know it doesn't have to be high the auction activity", "transcript": "Hi, welcome and we're gonna be having a look at the gold market and the execution order flow type is going to be a Momentum breakout play and what we're gonna be looking at the specific pattern is called a stop hunter So the stop hunter you're locating a key Technical breakout level where the market shifts from congestion.
