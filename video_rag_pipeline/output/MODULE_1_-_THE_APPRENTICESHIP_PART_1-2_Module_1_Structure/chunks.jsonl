What does the structure look like for the module? It's very simple. It's broken down into 5 key elements that you'll find across all 4 parts of Module 1. The first element is theoretical principles. Every part will begin with theoretical principles. Once we've completed those theoretical principles, we will then have practical examples. Now, across Module 1, there are in total 19 theoretical principles. At the end of each part, we're going to have learning videos and a summary video. This is to ensure that you understand the principles that we've taught throughout each part. In total, there'll be 10 of these learning videos and summary videos. We'll then have profile replay. The profile replay is a replay of any given day that's backdated whereby we can stop, start and pause any given day as the profile is being distributed across various prices. This allows us to view patterns in real time and ensure we're picking up on the various characteristics that you find whilst a distribution is occurring on any given day. We'll then have a concept checker at the end of each part. Again the concept checker is to ensure that you've understood all the principles taught throughout each part. And last but not least, at the end of every part, there will be a playbook entry. This playbook will be provided to you and you will then have to complete it before moving on to the next section. In total, there will be 9 playbook entries throughout Module 1. Good luck!", "transcript": "Welcome to Module 1. What does the structure look like for the module? It's very simple.
