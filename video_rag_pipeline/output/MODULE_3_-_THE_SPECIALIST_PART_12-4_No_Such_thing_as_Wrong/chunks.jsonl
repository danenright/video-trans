Now what I'll tell you is that the idea of a trade being wrong or right, or a strategy being wrong or right, it tends to be amongst traders who believe that the markets are And this again comes from probably a lot of the teaching you find in textbooks, as well as courses and as well as the so-called market gurus out there. Now the important thing to understand is there is no such thing as a wrong strategy. There is a strategy with a high probability outcome and a strategy with a low probability outcome. And that's important to understand. Remember, the objective of trading is not to be wrong or right. The objective of trading is to make money. Now, you can develop strategies that don't really make sense, they don't make sense in terms of risk, in terms of scalability, in terms of a lot of factors, and some may deem this wrong strategy, but at the end of the day, if the desired outcome is green, that is all that matters. So what are some of the things you need to think about when developing your strategy to, well, develop those strategies? Define your strategy in terms of high and low probability. Then, what is the risk profile of that strategy? Now again another fallacy in the markets is that professional traders take risk reward of 1 to 1 and 2 to 1 and 5 to 1 and 10 to 1. I will tell you this is absolute hocus-pocus. Day traders sometimes actually take inverse risk reward where we're taking on more risk just to achieve the desired outcome. Now some may think this is wrong. But it isn't. Remember, our objective is to be green. In terms of scalability, sometimes trades you cannot scale up very much. Sometimes trades you can scale up a lot. There is no wrong or right when it comes to scalable. However, keep in the back of your mind that a trade that's not very scalable will only last you so long. And whilst you're trying to get bigger and the objective is to make bigger trades with more leverage, a trade that's not very scalable isn't necessarily wrong. but it might mean you need to adjust your strategy or change or use other strategies in the future. In terms of repetitive patterns, some people may think just because a strategy only comes in along once a year, they may think the strategy is wrong or not worth the time. Again, I tell you, a strategy is good so long as you can find repetitive examples, The important thing is you can repeat the strategy with the same methodology and the same desired outcome. Does the strategy make sense to you? If it doesn't make sense to you, the likelihood is you're probably not going to execute it very well. In this sense, it's probably a low probability strategy.", "transcript": "In the next section of part 12, we're going to talk about one of my favourite parts of trading, and that is the idea that there is such a thing as wrong.
