We're going to start off and talk about where the market opens, whether it's in balance or out of balance. Now, as you can see, the guy on the tightrope is balancing quite nicely and the basic illustration here is that when the market is in balance, there tends to be a lot of control, a lot of two-way trade being facilitated. However, if all of a sudden things become shaky on the tightrope, then we start to see a little bit of panic, a little bit of volatility, a little bit of range expansion and that is why we want to differentiate between a market that is in balance and a market that is out So, as we could see, a market that is in balance, it opens within the previous day's value area. So where the market accepted prices the previous day, where buyers and sellers said, we are happy to agree as this being the fairest price on the day, if we open in and around that fair value, the market is said to be in balance. Now remember, when we're in balance, the market is said to be in firm control. when we are in balance there's a lower risk and therefore less opportunity. So what we mean by that is that there's a there's a 50-50 chance when we're in balance that the market goes up or that it goes down. So again there's slightly less opportunity or slightly less conviction in or going down. So crucial you understand that because again it brings us back to that concept of do we want to be aggressive when the market is not showing that sort of aggressiveness. Now, more time is spent when we are in balance. We do tend to spend a lot of time trading within the previous day's value. So it's almost like the market says, we accepted these prices the day before, there's a higher probability we're going to initially accept these prices again today, whilst we await further information. Now, the opposite to that is where a market opens out of balance. Now, when we open out of balance, we're opening outside of the value area or the accepted area of the previous day. So we almost get this idea where the market said previously, the day before, we accepted We're going to open lower or higher than where we accepted and then we're going to decide do we re-enter the previous day's accepted area, do we accept a new area today. So again, the mere fact that we're opening out of balance creates an indecision, it creates a little bit of uncertainty, a little bit of volatility and that brings opportunity with it. There's a higher risk when we do open out of balance, why? Because there's that uncertainty, there's that potential to move one way or the other.", "transcript": "We're now going to begin developing the concept of trade location, in other words, where we are trading relative to previous prices.
