Premium is the prices at which sellers aggressively enter the market in order to capture a price Markets will very quickly move away from premium prices, and often these are depicted with tails or very aggressive sell-side price action. Once a market has determined a certain price as premium, the price becomes a pivotal area for future reference. So again, just like discounted prices where buyers enter aggressively to pick up those prices and the advantage, sellers enter when prices enter or enter a premium or an area known as premium prices. Now note, the key thing in both discount and premium prices worth mentioning is that the point at which a price is deemed a discount or premium, in the future that price point becomes a key pivot point. And we will discuss this at a later stage when talking about strategy, but this is something you definitely want to watch out. The last principle we want to talk about is excess or exuberant prices. When the auction process extends beyond prices of fair value as well as discount and premium prices we then enter excess prices or exuberant prices. The reasoning behind these prices being advertised stem from the psychology behind buyers and sellers. And, as such, markets can advertise at prices which would under normal circumstances seem illogical. These are deemed excess or exuberant prices. Whilst these prices can often be reversed relatively fast, timing is essential, as markets can remain illogical a lot longer than investors remaining liquid. The key point to note is once a market finds an excess top or bottom, these tend to hold as highs and lows for longer periods as the market begins a process of balancing and stability. So note, when you find a market starts to move well beyond what makes logical sense, it's not that you want to be fighting this, you do not want to stand against However, once the market does find a turning point, that is where you want to step in with confidence and go against the trend, because once that market finds that high or low in exuberant prices, we tend to hold those prices for some months.
