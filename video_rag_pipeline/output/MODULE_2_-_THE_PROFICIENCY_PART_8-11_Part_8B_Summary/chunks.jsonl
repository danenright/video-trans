So just with regards to deliberate practice, it's crucial, crucial, crucial that you understand that trading is like any skill. time to develop your skillset. It takes time to develop your patterns and it'll take time to develop consistency in the marketplace. So the important thing is that you put in place deliberate practice measures. Now the reason we have, you know, sort of we want to deliberately practice things is because one, when we're deliberately practicing something, it's helping us develop routine. It's helping us develop discipline. helping us develop trust in what we are doing and trying to achieve. There's various ways you can exhibit deliberate practice, just like a sportsman or a footballer will kick a corner kick 20, 30, 40 times in one session. We need to watch various strategies time and time and time again, and we need to see these patterns in various markets, in various trade locations, in various contexts. When we do this, when we identify the same pattern across multiple different asset you're going to become masters of that strategy. And that is why we want to do this exact practice. More importantly, we can also do playback functionality. Playback functionality allows us to look at how a day type played out. So what we can do is look at a day type in the beginning. We can then have our hypothesis in place and then fast forward the day over a period of say a half an hour or hour and try and trade the day as it is occurring. put ourselves in a position as though we were allocating real capital. And, then last but not least, back testing. Back testing is a great form of deliberate practice where we're constantly looking at our strategies, constantly developing and evolving them as the conditions vary and adjust in the marketplace.

Now what I'm going to go through is just the basics of what a daily trading sheet would look like, but then I'm going to spend some time on the basic premise of a template, of how to take everything we've learned so far in module one, in module two, and almost summarize it in a very short space. And by summarizing it like that, information, put it into a few little lines and come out with a very good understanding as well as hypothesis and strategies we can employ. So a typical trading sheet will always start with our week's goals. Now I see so many traders that don't have goals in mind. You have to have goals and those goals can be short term, they can be long term, it doesn't really matter. mind. What we then typically look at is the calendar, what is likely to occur over the period of the session. Again, the calendar or key data will bring volatility and will bring range expansion into the market. We then start off typically our day by registering where the closes and the opening calls might be. Now, again, this might differ for various traders, but important if you're trading the European session, you need to know what happened in the overnight session. If you're trading the US session, you need to know how the European session is traded. We then want to look at some of the key, in this example, some of the key overnight indicators being maybe the Asian equity indices, you know, maybe the yen given it's a highly traded currency, but it's also a good correlation currency with risk on and risk off, as well as the gold, the dollar, and the VIX. Again, this is not necessarily the, you know, the indications or the indicators you need to look at, but you need to look at indications with what the market has done whilst you've been away.

So that's the first part that we would typically do pre-open of the market. Then we would move on to utilising or creating our template using volume profiling. We would start off by identifying the previous or the potential for day type. So straight away, this would be done somewhere between the first hour of trade. We would try and identify what kind of day type did we exhibit on the previous day. It was normal distribution. non-trend, neutral day, normal variation, trend day, double distribution. So straight away, we look at the previous day and we try and create for ourselves a little bit of understanding as to what we could potentially expect today. We then look at the open. So we look at the first out trade. How does the market open today based on what we had yesterday? Is it a strong convicted open with an open drive or is it more an open auction? We then look at what kind of a nature is the market and what type of context is the market currently bracketing? Are we seeing a lot of overlapping type profiles or are we seeing trending profiles where we have very little overlap? We would then look at our value area location. So over the past couple of days or over yesterday to today, where are we opening and then how much value area overlap again. We'll talk a little bit more about this in module three. And then we're gonna talk about some of the key identifiers, the control identifiers like low volume areas or high volume areas. Excess points in the previous days like tails gaps open closed gaps Volume point of control what location is what shape is it? Is it protruding is it are there a number of prices that could have been the volume point of control and then any of the Anomalies we could have seen over the previous day We'll then talk about initiative buying and selling. So we'll look at the previous day's auctions, we'll look how the market auction and look where the initiative came in, where the response came in, try and get an understanding of where the interaction points were coming between buyers and sellers. And lastly, we'll look for our key reference points in the market. Now, these reference points can be a high and a low, they can be major support and resistance, they can be major trend line breaks, they could be any number of factors.

Once we have completed all of this, this analysis, this understanding, we then have a process whereby we can develop our strategy for the day. Now, again, you can do this as you can see in this example of a trade sheet. You can see this is done predominantly for German Bunds and European stocks. This can be done across any multitude of markets, whether it's oil, gold, Euro stocks, E-Money, S&Ps, it does not matter. The important thing to understand here is the process is the same regardless. Lastly, on a typical trading sheet, you would also have your trotting routine. So again, just keeping you within a process, you know, where are the key weekly markers? You know, where are your key volume lines?

You are behind everyone who has planned better than you. That is why we plan because then we are prepared and we trust in what we are trying to do and achieve.
