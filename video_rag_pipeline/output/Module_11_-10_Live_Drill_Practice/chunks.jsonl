Record your observations learning using the following worksheet journal template. Click on there and open that up and look how it's structured and designed. It's structured in such a way so you learn in a very methodical way so you know how to isolate various different plays and which plays are actually really working for you. Do you actually just really do really well on the blowout? reversal attacks, or do you do really well in identifying those accumulation zones when the market shifts its personality? As you open and see that worksheet, you've got to enter the market that you're trading, the time that you're trading it, because you'll start observing various time patterns that it works best, and various time patterns that it doesn't. As your observation points become greater, and you have a larger sample set in your Then what type of trade execution strategy did you employ? Did you employ a blowout attack reversal? Was an accumulation distribution around a core hold or were you just scalping in and out? Once you notice the market moved at a certain speed and then that speed changed and you observed a clear seller in the market That was reloading the offer. Then did you just scalp it in and out and did you distribute your scalp? How did you trade it? What worked if you distribute your scope in the market went on another leg? didn't work out. What did you learn from these trades that didn't work out? The trades that don't work out is where you actually learn the absolute most. As you execute the trade, what was the personality change that you observed? Was it an absorption? Was there a flipper or a spoofer? Was there a large order that came on the order book or was it just an iceberg order? These are all key considerations and as you build your observation points throughout the entire year, this is one week of exclusive practice but you want to employ this learning throughout your entire career as you develop the pattern recognition skills you've reviewed this entire module and all the explanations and reviewing the ladder video that I showed, well then you're going to start really developing your own analysis and understanding of the market using this template worksheet.
