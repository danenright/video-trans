In relative terms, where are we trading?

When we use the trade location to interpret market weaknesses and strengths, we can then determine whether there's confidence or a lack of confidence. So for example, let's say the previous session we had a relatively muted session, a balanced market trading within the previous day's value accepted area. Now on the next morning the market tries to open drive but cannot sort of see the to continue and extend to the upside. Now, straight away, we expect to see confidence with an open drive, so if we're not seeing it, it's telling us that, you know, whilst there might be a little bit of confidence, it's not as strong. So we lean on the previous day's sort of referencing points to determine the level of confidence or lack of confidence. Then, the three trade locations or basic trade locations we get that we can identify based on the previous session are firstly, if we open in value area, so if we open within the previous day's value area inside of the previous day's range. The second trade location is if we open outside of the previous day's value area And the last trade location is if we open up completely outside of the previous day's value as well as the previous day's range.
