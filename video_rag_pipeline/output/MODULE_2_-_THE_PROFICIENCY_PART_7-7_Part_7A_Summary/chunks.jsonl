Now what we spoke about... throughout predominantly part 7a was, we started off with two types of auction rotations you can expect to find. And we said the first and most common is where we have a lot of two-time framing going on. So what do we mean by that? Well, very simply, it's merely where we get a lot of overlap between auction rotations. Now, if this is our first auction rotation and the next auction rotation, then the third auction rotation, and then maybe continue a little bit higher and then over the course of the day maybe head a little bit lower and effectively all we're getting there is a lot of two way type auction rotations. The more directional aggressive type is where we have a one time framing auction process and that merely is where we have a series of higher lows and higher highs or equally a series of lower highs and lower lows. The key identifier and what's important to understand is that when a market is either one time framing up or one time framing down, there is a sense of control from either the buyers and the sellers. We want to identify that control quite early so that we don't stand up against it but We then spoke very briefly about within these various auction rotations or individual TPO auctions we spoke about volatility contraction and expansion. Contraction is nothing more than when we have very narrow TPO print. So very, very relatively small but we move from very wide to suddenly very small. Equally, volatility expansion is merely the opposite where we move from having relatively and then contracting again. So again, we want to be able to differentiate between contracting, volatility contraction within the auction rotations as well as expansion. And the reason is that we want to identify what created that, what was the cause of that sudden shift in volatility, and then equally, why did we suddenly quieten down? Was it a case of we found responsive buying, was it a unwind what caused that volatility both contraction and expansion. Remember, every little piece of information you interpret and understand will give you a better understanding of why", "transcript": "Hi guys and welcome back to part 7a of the Blackboard Learning Series.

Was it a case of we found responsive buying, was it a unwind what caused that volatility both contraction and expansion. Remember, every little piece of information you interpret and understand will give you a better understanding of why prices are trading where they are, but more importantly, we can utilize that information to make very objective probability hypothesis as to where price might go in future. We then moved on and we spoke about various types of market excess and we had a nice example with the Mr. Baker man who creates these loaves of bread and as he sells, as he gets a little bit greedy and lifts the price of those loaves of bread, we start to see the demand wane or we start to see a less response in that auction process. We spoke about these excesses how at various prices, whether they're excess to the a lack of interaction or two-way trade occurring when we get to these excesses. Some examples of excess that we spoke about include firstly tails. Now remember a tail isn't just a very quick sort of rotation away from high or low prices Now invisible tail is the same as a tail except we don't always see it on the volume profile because it might not be the first Letter of the day. So again just for a basic example if this is our initial trade we have our initial balance buying tail and we can see that that tail holds over the period of the morning. That tail then is just a traditional opening tail. Now, over the course of the day, we might move higher and suddenly we leave the following tail. So we leave an X tail where the market comes up, up, up, up, up, and suddenly the market leaves a big X tail. We return to the distribution of the day. This now becomes a tail over the course of the day. An invisible tail is nothing more than, let's say we came back up here a second time and suddenly we had a very, very aggressive rotation lower on the very next print. an equal and opposite almost, we came back up a second time and the market rejected straight back down, showing us that that first tail is still very, very valid. It seems invisible or it doesn't seem like a tail because we've obviously had a TPO print there over the course of the day.
