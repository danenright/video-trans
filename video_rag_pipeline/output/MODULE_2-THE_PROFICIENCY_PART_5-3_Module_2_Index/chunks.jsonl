Well, in part 5 we're going to start off talking about time, price and volume as key identifier. We'll then move on to initiative and responsive price pattern behaviour.

Then in part 7 we're going to move on to daytime auctions, market auction excess, volume pointer controls, auction control variables and finish with high volume errors In part 8 we'll finish with key control identifiers, distinct profile pattern strategies, volume profile templating and deliberate practice.", "transcript": "So what will module 2's index look like?
