I think that most of you are hoping for So again, just like we did in one of the previous units. I wanted to give you a slightly different variation of the Delta unwind now The first thing to interpret is that let's just look at the market context. So we can see the market sold off quite aggressively in oil We sold off all the way down from you know, 58 6 30s all the way down to sort of 55 96 or so Technically speaking, we've captured a little bit of a short positioning in the market, technically. We know that not just because of price, but we also know it because of where the trade location was holding. The only thing that doesn't really kind of work together with this delta position unwind is that we actually have got quite a positive delta on the day. So you can see down below the delta is positive 4650. So if we were going to see a delta unwind we wouldn't want to ideally be seeing it to the upside but rather to the downside. Sometimes you do get delta unwinds that are within the range. So a lot of time the delta unwinds, the market will extend maybe all the way to the low, capture some short positions or to the high and capture some long positions. Slowly but surely we start to reverse to that line in the sand area that we spoke about and once we get above or below that line in the sand we unwind quite aggressively. Now in the example I'm going to show you, some sort of a trend line. We could very clearly see that line in the sand comes in around about that 56-15 area. So let's watch what happens and let's see how the market responds. Now the first thing to note is that we're likely to get some some rush to the upside. Not necessarily a delta, and why? Why? Because we obviously still have a very positive Straight away, we can see that the market does, however, once it gets above this 15s, note the reaction, and this is why this is quite an interesting example. We do get quite a surge in volume, so a pick-up in the volume and a pick-up in the there. They might not be short positions in a delta sense, but they definitely are short positions. As we can see the market getting above those 16's we get a volume surge. Now this is crucial because a lot of the time we assume that a cumulative delta means positioning.

In other words, we assume that because the market has a positive 5,309 delta that the particularly over role events or big fundamental events, the delta can be skewed. Delta does not always equal market positioning. It's a rough indication, but it's not a perfect example of market positioning. So just bear that in mind when you do your analysis. Okay, now obviously the market then rotates a little bit, and I just want to talk about, we get this little bit of a two-way trade here. We can see the market holding up So all of a sudden the market comes in, obviously we see quite a bit of absorption at the low, a little bit of a negative delta, nothing really going on in terms of volume, so we can see no real changes in volume, and suddenly the market just goes very aggressively Okay, so the chart's back, and note, we suddenly see the market go quite aggressively bid up. So straight away, I just want to pause it there. Now again, how do we know this is a Delta unwind, or how do we know this is a position unwind? Okay, it's very simple. One, it's occurring in the middle of the range, and two, look at the structure of the footprint. Okay, a lot of imbalances, a lot of zeros all over the show, and a very aggressive In essence, it's still a very good example of an unwind of the positioning in the market. It's just not necessarily an unwind in a typical sense where we have a negative delta in this example would have been more picture perfect for us. Okay, so I'm just going to play that through. Obviously the market does then continue the process of stopping out, unwinding all those positions once we get beyond that line in the sand. Ok guys, very basic example, very simple example of stops occurring in the middle of the range. Do go and have a look at that, play that through again. Remember delta unwinds, sometimes it is going to be picture perfect and it is going to unwind the delta that is there, but sometimes the delta can be also a little bit confusing so just make sure that you understand the difference.
