So where do you begin? Well, firstly you've recognised the pattern using volume profiling. Every single day you do your debrief and you're noticing that at a certain point in time, at maybe an area on the volume profile, something sticks out that seems to be occurring more often than not. They're going to put risk on the table, they take the trade idea on, they understand the basic premise of the idea, but they don't fully develop a strategy around the subject of idea. Now, this is completely wrong, and in the long run this is not going to develop edge for you. In the long run, yes, you might get it right a few times, but in the long run you're not going to learn to trust the trade strategy. More importantly, when the trade strategy evolves, you're not going to be able to And that is why we develop unique trade strategy. Now I'm going to show you a process to developing this trade strategy so that you develop trust in the strategy, so that you develop understanding and belief and interpretation, but most importantly so that you can learn to leverage up on these unique trading strategies. Remember guys, and we will discuss this in part 12, one of the key trading secrets and I will explain to you a little bit later on why. So, what should you do? It's simple. Reverse engineer. Start at the end. You understand the end result. You understand what should and what often occurs. So reverse engineer it. How did it get to that point? Where did it come from? How did it get there? How long did it take? Now, first and foremost, this is the step by step process to developing your trade strategy. Again, this is not an exhaustive This is merely the list that I utilise every single time I develop a new strategy. So number one, name the opportunity. Call it whatever you want, but make it related to the trade setup. Now an example was a trade strategy I used back in my early trading days called the Aggressive Aggressor. going against when I thought there was a technical bias in the market and it always felt so aggressive it always used to make me feel so unsettled and and it used to really really frustrate me and it used to bring up some serious emotions that you know with inside me and I kind of got this impression that you know the market would aggressively move one way and then even more aggressively in the opposite direction. So what did I call it? The aggressive aggressor. I learned from something that cost me money, turned it into a strategy, and instead of losing money now in the same strategy, I started making money.

And so I called it the Aggressive Aggressor. It relates to this trade strategy. Now once you've named it, you then need to characterise the trade opportunity. This is like storyboarding. Create an understanding as to what's happening. Maybe the buyers are thinking prices are cheap and they really really want to get involved and take whatever prices they can and keep going higher and higher and higher until someone starts selling it to them and then they want to jump out of the way. Create the story in your head. It's this story that you're going to be telling yourself time and time and time again when you take on the strategy. So create the story. That's how you learn to remember these strategies. What are some of the things you need to look out for when characterizing the trade strategy? Firstly, when and where does it occur? What time does it occur? Is there high volume or is there low volume in this trade strategy? What's the price action like? So how is the market moving? How are buyers and sellers responding in this trade strategy? What are some of the observations you can see within the strategy? What time of day is it? What time of the year is it? What month is it? Is it occurring after data? Is it occurring in the US session? In the European session? This is not an exhaustible list. What you want to do is characterise the strategy in every single possible way. Then, you want to define the rules and preconditions for taking on the strategy. So firstly, what time of day do you And what is your expectation analysis? Now, an expectation analysis is particularly important. So what is it? In simple terms, it's what you would expect to see. So let's take a basic example of a breakout trade. Now in a breakout trade, we expect to see a pick-up in volume, a pick-up in the volatility, and a little bit of initiation from either the buyers or sellers. These are our expectations. So if we take on a breakout strategy and we do not see these expectations, so maybe we see a lot of two-way trade on a breakout, that is telling us straight away that this strategy is not playing out according to our expectations. Now again, a lot of the time these expectations can actually get us out of good trades, and that is why we have an expectation analysis. So those are some of the rules and preconditions you will develop for that trade strategy. Now the reason we develop these rules and preconditions", "transcript": "aggressively in the opposite direction. So what did I call it? The aggressive aggressor.
