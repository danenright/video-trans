Now, this is important to understand because when there's excessive volatility, it can be particularly uncomfortable with regards to managing size effectively or risk management. So remember, first and foremost, our job is to manage risk effectively. So we can do that by interpreting if this is a fundamental trend or if it's a technical if you were to compare say a technical trending move, these are a lot more powerful and they're a lot more enjoyable to trade simply because they don't have this excess volatility and you can size up quite nicely on them and manage risk quite well. So that's why technical fundamentals tend to be a little bit easier and better to trade but do remember the flip side to a fundamental and the advantage to a fundamental is that it pays out quicker, okay? So you have to sit and trade for a far shorter time, so you do get paid for taking on that excessive volatility, but it is a more uncomfortable type of trend. So that's the first thing to interpret when it comes to what type of trend day. Now... What we're going to do is we're going to play this example through. What we have here is the German Bund again.

Okay, so what I mean by that, within roughly two to three hours of the session beginning you will know that we are in a trend day. At the end of the session, they tend to trend. from the beginning.
