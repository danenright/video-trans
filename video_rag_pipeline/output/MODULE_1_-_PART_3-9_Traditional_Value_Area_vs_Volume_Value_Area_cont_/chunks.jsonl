They are fair value, discount, premium and exuberant prices. So first and foremost, fair value. Fair value is the the point at which buyers and the sellers agree to a certain price. These are price levels that are trade over various timeframes. When fair value is established, it will require a change in fundamentals or perception to move beyond what was deemed fair. By that token, once fair value is established, the market spends time within the price boundaries of fair value. This is the price where an area in which 70% of all trade, whether that's time or volume, is being accepted. It's merely the point where buyers and sellers agree with one another. How do we move out of fair value? Well it requires a very big shift in perception or fundamentals to move us away from fair value. So by that token, Mark could spend a long long time within fair value. What's the next principle? Discount prices. As the name suggests, a discount price is the price at which a buyer aggressively enters the market in order to capture a price being advertised at a lower price than perceived fair value. Markets will very quickly move away from discounted prices and often these are depicted with tales or very aggressive buy-side price action. Once a market has determined a certain price is a discount, the price becomes a pivotal In essence, if something's cheap, buyers are going to step in very aggressively to take advantage of it being cheap. Now what is cheap? Well it's a matter of perception. So we don't just assume that any price is cheap, we allow the market to tell us based on its response that there is a discount, and then we respond. Do note, fair value does not equal market value. Just because a market is accepting prices doesn't mean that is fair value, or just because a market accepts something as the market value doesn't mean it's fair value, which means we can for a long long time move up and down away from prices trying to establish where fair value is.", "transcript": "We're going to conclude part three now and talk about four basic important principles you're going to see in volume distribution profiling.
