You know, we look at it from an almost textbook approach of what we're looking at, the reasons behind the patterns, we start the first part of the course by just looking a bit of the theory. Then we the next step is looking at the application. followed by the application of how you actually engage on the price ladder, how you execute your orders, what type of orders you can execute, what type of trading strategies you can execute, why does a price ladder and the environment of the price ladder react under certain conditions, and then after we really engage in that application, well then you need to your ability to recall those patterns. By practicing you really put strong concrete foundation in the theory and the application because the practice now starts resulting in communication between your unconscious state and your conscious state and the moment you build up your own conscious state, your gut intelligence, when you trade in the marketplace and your instinctual intelligence really starts increasing where as a trader you don't have to think anymore, you just are having manner in order to deploy the right strategies and then after that then after you've deployed and after you've practiced Well, then we have to give you the feedback from a professional trading perspective and the feedback on the trading pattern And when you get that feedback, you can align any error you know any error of your understanding because you don't want that error count diverging too much from the reality of your execution of your trade. So this entire mechanism and we'll go through it in each bullet point as I mentioned over here the method we employ in our training protocol is based on a cognitive rapid skill development technique which is immersed in the following framework that I've just spoken about and I know that's a fancy word the cognitive rapid skill development All that really is saying is, how do you record patterns that you see in the market day in day out for a novice trader who is looking at the price ladder, he effectively just sees a whole bunch of moving numbers that don't make sense. A trader who has a very strong framework, who has been involved in the market for countless years, when he looks at that ladder, he can see if the marketplace is ripe and ready for him to trade, or the marketplace is not ripe and ready for him to trade.

What does he actually see on the price ladder?", "transcript": "Okay, the exciting part now the methodology now already, you know throughout this pictorial representation of the entire learning framework that we'll be deploying in the AXIA Futures the theory.
