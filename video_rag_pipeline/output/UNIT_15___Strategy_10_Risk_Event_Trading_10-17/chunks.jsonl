That being said let's finish our final strategy session. Again market context obviously note we spoke about three different patterns, the trend trend, the initiative met by responsive as well as the initiative initiative reversal. So again all of them will have their own sort of trending and consolidation phases And again when you draw out your pattern make sure you know you're drawing out If it was a trend trend that I see trend trend was there too much You know response in the trend trend those are the kind of things you want to pay attention to Then in terms obviously balanced and imbalanced Again, imbalanced markets will have a higher potential to be volatile now One of the key takeaways from all three of these strategies that I showed you was that Market context is imperative to the way the market moves, okay?

Okay where were we trading? Were we trading in extreme? Were they key technical levels? Was there a key breakout? Were we in the middle of the range? Were we balanced? Were we imbalanced?

Okay, it's simply just automated strategies rather than institutional large time frame participants. In terms of liquidity, then... Note, again, you want to talk about where's the high liquidity, where's the low liquidity, what does the market do once it finds the liquidity based on the pattern you've recognized.

Okay let's now move on then to the strategy identification part of the template. So again when you look over these patterns again focus on the interaction. Like I said the footprint tool is unique for risk events because less participants you're going to very quickly see the interaction a lot quicker on the footprint.

Obviously, it's initiative initiative with the second Of the patterns trend balance its initiative and responsive with a third of the patterns reversal its initiative Initiative. So again, you know, make sure you're identifying the the the initiative and responsive price action What does it look like and you know, how can you identify it your future? Then in terms of passive aggressive again identify that the nature of the interaction is a passive aggressive. Where is it passive? Why is it passive? Why is it aggressive? Okay, in terms of the metrics again, we pay attention to all these metrics, you know volume time Delta cumulus Delta and relative change every one of these metrics will be will show a unique set of trace Compared to every one of the strategies. Okay trend trend. You will always have high volume You'll always have very shallow pullbacks and it'll happen very quickly in terms of time The Delta will always be incredibly strong in the direction of the trend trend The cumulus of Delta will race up in terms of the trend trend and the relative change will be very aggressive.

And that's the key is when you see those five elements, that's when you want to be aggressively executing, that's when you want to be employing your leverage and taking advantage of the opportunity the market's gifting you with. Let's now turn attention to our final part of our template, the execution. So the key from the execution is that you're going to need to learn to be a little bit uncomfortable, okay, you have to be quite aggressive in terms of execution with risk events. Now a way to get through this, and this is the best way to understand this, is that with these risk events, there is the potential for much greater reward, okay. The hardest part about these events is knowing the difference between, you know, what has got potentially big reward and what doesn't, okay. If you can identify high probability opportunities, the trade strategy execution is relatively straightforward. Equally, if you know, there's a very high probability of price to go up or down Ultimately, the execution is straightforward in the sense that one you can get in aggressively to you can be a relatively You know looser or not looser, but you can have slightly wider stops simply because you're gonna get much greater Reward opportunities. Okay again opportunity. It all depends on context. It all depends on that preparation you did beforehand a market that's imbalanced, much greater opportunity. A market that's relatively balanced, again, has great potential for reversal opportunity. In terms of risk-award, again, every one of these has got great potential risk-award, so long as you identify what ultimately is a good risk event with good opportunity. Application-wise, it's very exact, not a great deal. You don't need to, obviously, be... not necessarily smart but you just look for those identifiers a little bit of absorption and those key little signals and you enter on what the footprint is showing you rather than what you think. In terms of leverage with the big outliers as I mentioned with big opportunity we can take great leverage. Why? Because the odds are very heavily stacked in our favor. Now tip and my final tip for the not just the course but for this strategy 10, preparation is the key to successful execution. That's not just for the strategy, that's for everything, not just trading for life as well. Be prepared before every risk event because that preparation will pay you. All it takes is one outlier opportunity that you execute with leverage and you can make more money than you've made in six months in a couple of moments.

Black Box Thinking, the title gives it away. The same author as Bounce, okay great book as well if you haven't read it. Quite old Bounce, been around for a couple of years. Summary Edge is developed through smart open-loop processes. You probably would have heard me giving you a couple of these ideas. They aren't my own ideas. They were ideas that I have now not just adopted from Matthew Said, but I've actually gone and reinforced them and really recreated them for myself. So a great book. The action it's going to require or that it's going to promote is philosophy shifting. It's really going to make you think differently and that's why this is my number one pick. It's extremely thought provoking and will prompt some sort of a mindset shift. some of the key highlights understanding of cognitive dissonance fantastic concepts closed loop thinking as well as marginal gains with the use of practical examples is what I really liked about it not only did he introduce these concepts where most people get lost and they kind of get bored very quickly but then he he applies these concepts and you really really grasp the the concepts through the examples and that's why I think it's such Note he speaks heavily of the importance of growth through failure again. That's what this entire course has been about It's been about you know, this bottom-up approach of failing failing failing That's why we do the templates because the templates reflect our failures and through the templates We see the failures and only when we see the failures can we then find solutions and adopt a better process until we get to the Ultimate process that's what this entire template function is ultimately about A fact-based overview of some of the most relevant principles driving innovation and thought in the 21st century. And also how creative thinking comes about, which is a really good chapter as well, probably something not many of you might have thought about. And lastly, the secrets and understanding to high performance. Trading is a high-performance industry. It wasn't always, it is now. You're up against some of the smartest, fastest, most creative, biggest pockets. Don't forget, you are a small fish in a relatively large pond, so am I.

I think it was day Maybe day 10 or 9 somewhere around there go back and have a look how long that first template took you to complete Compared to how long it took you to complete this template, you should note a significant difference. Also, have a look how much writing you've got on the first template versus how much you've got now, okay? That's a reflection of the hard work you've done. That's a reflection of everything you've achieved through following the process of completing a template. Don't forget, you've achieved something remarkable. If you have followed the day-to-day challenge, congratulations, that's brilliant. If you have completed a template at the end of every drill, you are a superstar. Well done. Now, once you've done obviously with that final template, go through the guided tuition. You can then obviously go and view some of the examples we utilized within the unit. You can then complete again, or not you can, you should complete another template. Once you're comfortable, you're not going to move on to the next unit because that is the end then of the course. Let's now move on to our final thought slide where I'll leave you with a closing message. So that brings us then to the final thoughts of the Footprint Course. Firstly, congratulations. It's a fantastic achievement to get to the end of the 30-day challenge. It's not been easy. I know a lot of you have got full-time jobs, full-time careers, you're full-time parents, but congratulations on one, taking the step, but two, completing and pretty much finishing what you've started. But hopefully you've learned something unique along the way because there's been so many fantastic principles we've covered as well as so many unique strategies that don't necessarily act as standalone strategies but can act as other guides to the way the markets are moving and potential targets etc etc. So I really really want to thank you for taking the course. Now Some of the most key elements like the checklist we had obviously in unit one.

Secondly develop a Okay, this is what this whole course has been about. It's been about failures, but learning from those failures Okay, everyone every one of my trade strategies every one of my successes has come from failure Okay, I was no different to any one of you. I started trading in 2011. I failed many times I've you know been at a zero count. I've wiped out a really big account. I've done all the failures Okay, some of you might be you know there right now and you might be at different stages of your career but ultimately the beautiful part about having those failures is I know where I've been and I know where I am now so don't be afraid to fail. Failure is important to ultimately get to success. Understand the principles that govern price movements. This is crucial. Prices don't go up or down because of the tool. The footprint is not the holy grail. It isn't. It's not going to make you profitable. It's not going to put pounds in your bank account. The footprint is going to allow you to view the interaction taking place between buyers and sellers. That is the Your goal is to develop a strategy-based approach and extract information from this tool to give you that understanding and confirmation that it's time to execute. Don't forget that. Then fourth, develop strong process habits with template completion and creation. Don't stop with this template. You've done such a remarkable job. redevelop it, add to it, adjust it, do whatever you want but make sure you keep templating, make sure you keep stenciling you know how you're executing how you're viewing the markets against what the markets are showing you. That way you can develop a very strong process of ultimately recognizing and executing patterns. Now obviously you've got ten patterns you don't have to adopt them all you can adopt one that's fine you can adopt one variation within one Adopt what makes sense to you characteristically. If you're someone that likes momentum, don't bother with counter-trend strategies. Focus on the breakouts. Focus on the initiative imbalances. Focus on things that make sense to you characteristically. Apply those strategies. Most importantly then, as you begin to develop those strategies, you have to keep adopting them and ultimately adapting them.

I've done all the failures Okay, some of you might be you know there right now and you might be at different stages of your career but ultimately the beautiful part about having those failures is I know where I've been and I know where I am now so don't be afraid to fail.

The footprint is going to allow you to view the interaction taking place between buyers and sellers. That is the Your goal is to develop a strategy-based approach and extract information from this tool to give you that understanding and confirmation that it's time to execute. Don't forget that. Then fourth, develop strong process habits with template completion and creation. Don't stop with this template. You've done such a remarkable job. redevelop it, add to it, adjust it, do whatever you want but make sure you keep templating, make sure you keep stenciling you know how you're executing how you're viewing the markets against what the markets are showing you. That way you can develop a very strong process of ultimately recognizing and executing patterns. Now obviously you've got ten patterns you don't have to adopt them all you can adopt one that's fine you can adopt one variation within one Adopt what makes sense to you characteristically. If you're someone that likes momentum, don't bother with counter-trend strategies. Focus on the breakouts. Focus on the initiative imbalances. Focus on things that make sense to you characteristically. Apply those strategies. Most importantly then, as you begin to develop those strategies, you have to keep adopting them and ultimately adapting them. You can't stay stagnant in this job.", "ocr_text": null, "visual_caption": null, "metadata": {"chunk_idx": 5}}

Obviously I utilize all 10 of the strategies across different markets so I know. and as you'll see now when we finally get to the the bonus material we even applied it to bitcoin on a on a wonderful day in december i think we got four or five different of the footprint strategies all in a four or five hour time session so it was really great to see that the footprint can really be you know nicely applied to even the bitcoin market lastly don't be afraid to lean on your peer-to-peer group okay it's there for you to share ideas Alright guys, that then brings us to the end of the Footprint course and I want to finish with a quote. I think that's probably the most effective way to summarise this entire course. It comes from the master again, Paul Tudor Jones himself. The real growth comes from handling the uncomfortable process. Be willing to fail. If you're willing to fail, you will grow.
