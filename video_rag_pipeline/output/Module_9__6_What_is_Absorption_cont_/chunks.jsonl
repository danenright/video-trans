So when large participants, such as institutional investors, need to buy and sell large amounts of securities for their portfolio, they can divide their large orders into smaller parts so that the public sees only a small portion of the order at a time. Just as the tip of the iceberg, it's only a visible portion of a huge mass of ice. caused by substantial changes in stock supply and demand. the large order book strategies we notice that if we observe as locals a large order and it's a genuine large order once we've defined that it's identified that there's a high probability of being a large order you can effectively move the market away from that large order and therefore that large order is having to execute at at worse prices so this is the really the rise of the iceberg the iceberg order is that if you don't display a order that sticks out like an iceberg on the price ladder, you can effectively get away more advantageous prices as you don't get the market to chase. But when locals and intraday traders observe the reloading of a price and absorption, we can actually start trading within that iceberg and therefore it's the ability of the trader to observe that iceberg before that iceberg disappears and you can actually start sculpting, extrapolating profits from the iceberg order. So remember, iceberg orders are used to avoid locals and other market participants front running at the order, as we've just discussed. You get manual versus automatic iceberging. The most predominant one are your automatic icebergs. So you put in an order, if you go look on the training technologies, order types, you go look at iceberg, how to actually construct your iceberg pattern, we'll be you know, in the videos and really making you understand what an iceberg order looks like when we go through our price ladder order plays and strategies that we do deploy. Other trader lingo for iceberging is reloading, so you'll hear a lot of traders, they don't really call it iceberging, they say, oh, someone's reloading the bid or someone's So that's when a trade is making observation of a buy or seller at a price or a price zone. You can have an iceberg that's distributed within five or ten ticks and so this is important these are other important considerations. The time frame and purpose of the iceberging ensure It really ensures that it gets the best price fills without being front run if the order, the entire order is disclosed. So effectively, why do institution traders use absorption order book events? It's the best method to observe a key absorption event. So really critical to understanding, you know, what is an iceberg?
