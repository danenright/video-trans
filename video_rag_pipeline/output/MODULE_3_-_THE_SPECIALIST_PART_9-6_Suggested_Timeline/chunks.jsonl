The entire module should take you roughly 13 and a half hours. Now, in part 9, I've allocated one hour to principles, a half an hour to the summary checker and the blackboard series, and two and a half hours to the playbook. In part 10, I've allocated 30 minutes to principles, 30 minutes to concept checker blackboard series and two and a half hours to your playbook. Then in part 11, again 30 minutes to principles, 30 minutes to your summary and concept checker and two and a half hours to the playbook. And lastly, part 12, again 30 minutes to principles, 30 minutes to the concept checker As you will notice, we're going to spend an extensive amount of time developing our playbooks. As you go through the module, you'll understand why. The way I've structured this module 3 is that I'm going to spend a little less time Rather, I'm now going to spend a lot of time helping you not just understand the 11 strategies that I've developed over my career, but more importantly, spend a lot of time getting you finding those strategies within the markets, so that not only do you understand those, not only do you begin to believe and trust in those strategies, but you begin to implement them into your very own trading. And lastly, I want to do it so that you can finally not just take my strategies, but begin to develop your own strategies.", "transcript": "This is the suggested timeline that I recommend you take when going through parts 9, 10, 11 and 12.
