We're then going to talk about three very distinct profiling patterns, which I'll break down for you again on the blackboard, show you sort of where the bias is and where the potential for trade strategies are. We're then going to finally put together module one and two and put all the principles we've dealt with into one volume profiling template. And that template you will use every single morning when you're prepping on a weekly basis. You'll constantly use that and it will help you to not just understand and summarize all the principles we've done so far in Module 1 and 2. talking briefly about deliberate practice as we're going to be utilizing a replay functionality quite a bit in module 3. So let's get straight into it and talk about those control identifiers. Now firstly What's important is to make sense of this information from volume profiling, it's important to be involved in the process that forms the profile. Those who stay with it will soon begin to visualize the completed profile before the like visually building a puzzle. So what I'm trying to point out to you is that you know sometimes you know there may be a low volume area or there may be you know a lot of two-way trade in the market and we can identify this. It doesn't necessarily imply we have a trade opportunity or or a viable trade strategy but what it does do is by watching and constantly interpreting what we're seeing it's aiding us to almost visually interpret what the day type may be Now, if over the course of the day suddenly the market does something against the objective or the facts in front of you, that might present the opportunity and that is why we're constantly observing, questioning and watching the day as it's playing out. As it plays out, we will slowly but surely learn to build the puzzle before it gets built and confirmed by the market. It's important to ask ourselves a lot of the time, what do we expect to see? If you're constantly asking yourself, what do you expect? What is your expectation? You will start to develop in your head this building of the day as it develops. Then if the market responded in a way counter to the principle that I've taught you and that you understand It's complete, you know, it's such invaluable information.

So again, those control identifiers, remember we had strong ones and we had weak ones that we spoke about in part seven. They are nothing more than sentiment signals or confidence signals. They show us the level of confidence in how the market is actually facilitating trade. First one, remember we spoke a little bit about tails. So remember with regards to the tails, size and location is crucial. We have invisible tails as well as sort of open and extreme tails. Now the important thing to understand is that the larger the tail, the larger the level of conviction or strength is at that given point. Equally, the larger the tail, the more significant the point is or the price is that we are rejecting or moving away from. as well as, obviously, where does that tail occur, alright? A tail in the middle of a trade location in a balanced area is far less significant than a tail formed when we are out of balance or in non-symmetrical type days. So, very crucial to interpret where is the location of the tail, but also what is the size. In terms of value area overlap, how much overlap do we get between yesterday's value area or where the market accepted price and where the market is accepting price today? Again, markets that are overlapping a lot of value area will tend to continue to do that until we get some market moving information, whereas if there's a lack of overlap in value areas, this could be showing us high potential for one time framing on a day-to-day basis.

Just remember, the less time a market takes to effectively accept or reject something, it's showing us one thing versus if a market is taking more time. Again, time regulates the opportunity. Don't forget to always interpret your strategies in terms of time. But some strategies should take relatively little time to play out and some strategies should take a long time. So again, if it comes counter to the principle, make sure you're interpreting this because this can be an early identifier for a potential of the failure of the strategy and even potential for reversal of the strategy. And then lastly, or second to last, if a market spends a long time at an important juncture point, the longer time spent reflects an increasing probability of failure. Just like we said, time regulates the opportunity. So time is a great barometer for conviction and confidence. Again, take for example when we spoke about initiative. There should be relatively little time when a market initiates and accepts to initiating again. If a market initiates and then spends a long, long time balancing out, it's highly likely that we've seen the end of this initiation, at least for the given time frame.
