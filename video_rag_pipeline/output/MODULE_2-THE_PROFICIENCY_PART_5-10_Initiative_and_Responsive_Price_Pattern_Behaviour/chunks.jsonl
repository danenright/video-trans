This is a market based principle and there's not enough people that understand this principle so I'm going to go very slowly through it because a lot of my strategies personally are developed based on the basic concept of initiative and responsive price pattern So, what is initiative and responsive price pattern behaviour? Well firstly, let's talk about initiative price action. So as the word suggests, initiative is when a buyer or seller or an influential buyer or seller takes the initiative to move prices. paper, you know, hedge fund. We spoke about these big large time frame participants back in module one. So someone comes in, they're influential and they are going to initiate a move in the market. Then, market participants make the play, or the influential participants, they make this play by initiating an order. Now the important thing to understand is he utilizes all the liquidity available. What does that mean? In other words, he's not going to necessarily be passive. He's going to initially start off very aggressively. Okay, so important you understand that initiative price action is a very aggressive order type where the market participant looks to lift either the bids or sell into the offer. Okay. Then if there is a lack of liquidity in other words if a buyer comes in and no one is willing to sell it to him He will then look very aggressive on the charts and it will appear as though the markets trending It's so crucial to understand this guys in other words if you look at a chart, and you see a very aggressive move alright A lot of the time it could be because a buyer or seller has stepped in but there hasn't been enough liquidity for him to execute the order at best price. Now, if however as the price moves up this long-term participant who's initiating finds responsive sellers or runs into a passive seller sitting on the offer, we will then likely see two-way trade and a more bracketed price response on the charts. Ok, the cash open opens and a big buyer from Goldman Sachs steps into the market, he's received the order to lift 20,000 bunds at best price for his client. Now this Goldman Sachs trader is going to be buying up the offer. Now one of two things can happen, he can go to the market and start buying up this offer and someone is willing to sell it to him, in which case the order flow will", "transcript": "This is by far one of my favorite topics when it comes to volume profiling, but more importantly this isn't actually just a volume profile principle.
