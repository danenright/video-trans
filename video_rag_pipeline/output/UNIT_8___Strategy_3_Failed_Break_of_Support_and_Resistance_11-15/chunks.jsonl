We've completed you starting to get the hang of what's expected of you when filling in these templates So let's get straight into it obviously in terms of market context one of the most important things We spoke about in the strategy was identifying what makes a good break. Okay in order for us to have a failed Break of support resistance. We actually have to first identify when there is a break Okay, we spoke a lot about you know support and resistance how we can identify what key support resistance is We spoke a lot about the low volume area and the the potential for single prints and imbalances to be left Once we have that break We then also mentioned a real pocket of low volume area from the breakout that needs to be filled out in a consolidatory manner. So the takeaway, and this is really key in terms of observing the strategy, is it's a really patient initial part of the strategy. With that in mind in terms of trending consolidating. Well, ideally we want to see trend on the break We want to see initiative and then obviously consolidation on the retail So once we do come back, we want to see quite a bit of two-way trade before we then re-enter range and aggressively reverse ideally big trend moves or initiative moves do tend to Be a little bit stronger when markets are in imbalanced as opposed to balanced and in terms of trade location We spoke a lot about, you know, where we can find key support and resistance and we spoke a lot about some of the important metrics to focus on to identify a key break and they were volume, speed, delta, a low volume area or imbalance. Now going forward, don't be afraid to shorthand text. You'll see I utilize the shorthand text of LVA quite a lot, or imbalance, I-M-B-A-L. Don't be afraid to shorthand text, okay? LVA just simply means low volume error, imbalance means imbalance. So you know, you learn to utilize and get through these observations with relative ease. Okay, in terms of marker The types of time frame participants. Well, ideally we need initiative. We need, you know, all the participants on the break That's what creates the heightened volume and aggressive nature of the break Then obviously once we get the unwind do note it's not so much the longer time frame participants, but rather the short-term and speculative participants Note those speculative participants include algorithms as well as obviously your speculative Participants now in terms of liquidity do note.

Let's now move on and have a look at the strategy identification. So again, obviously as the footprint tool is an interaction tool, this is quite a crucial part of the template. In terms of the type of interaction we expect to see, well, we would expect to see a lot of initiative from the break, some real aggressive pocket positioning, a lot of absorption, heavy heavy absorption, until such a point as the breakout finds some sort of response on the other side of the market. When we see those dark deltas coming in on the other side, we know we've found and that should show us potentially where the breakout is coming to a potential pause. Now do note obviously in terms of once we do come back we do expect to see not necessarily an initiative leg taken once we re-enter the previous range it's more of a stop-run and that's crucial to understand because the difference is if we had an initiative leg lower one it wouldn't be driven by the participants of just the algorithms and the speculative it would be all three participants including influential participants so that's key we will talk a lot about that in the strategy unit on initiative drives so do note initiative requires someone with influence which is a relatively large time frame Do note what that means obviously is initiative doesn't always has to have to reverse stops and stop runs As is this example they can potentially and very easily and often do reverse and fill out Okay in terms of then obviously the passive aggressive nature of the interaction aggressive on the brake and reversal passive in filling out the low volume area. We spoke a lot about that. Be patient. When the market's filling out a break point, it can take a couple of hours to fill it out before being in the process of the unwind. Okay, then. In terms of the key metrics, volume relatively high, you will see that in the relatively dark colors in the summary box.

In terms of the key metrics, volume relatively high, you will see that in the relatively dark colors in the summary box. Do note, obviously, the longer it fails to continue with a break, the higher the probability of failure. So once we've broken and we've extended on the breakout, the longer the market fails to then extend and continue in the direction of the break, the more likely for this potential trade strategy to become valid. Do note, obviously, this trade strategy only becomes valid at such a point that we actually do retest the previous breakpoint. So that's crucial to understand. There is no trade strategy until we retest the breakpoint. In terms of Delta it should go in the direction of trend as well as the cumulative Delta and obviously in terms of relative change you should see a lot of shifts in volume and Delta on the brakes and the reversals as well as in the price. So again observe what is price doing on the initial brake as well as the flush down or sorry what price is doing when we get the initial trend like move up or down and then obviously when we get the stop running in either direction you know what is the price action and the volume in the delta do in that instance. Now we're going to talk a little bit about the execution part of the template in the next slide. So in terms of execution some of the things we're going to pay attention to again do we want to be passive or aggressive we we can afford to be quite passive in this as obviously we're waiting for that consolidatory zone around the original breakout zone, okay? We did show you a great example there of how the market spent quite a bit of time auctioning around the breakout point before then obviously moving quite aggressively lower. Note, stop placement, you wanna put it in and around behind ultimately where that consolidation period is occurring within the breakout zone. In terms of target, we're looking for either an unwind of the Delta or the stop run which creates an exhaust of low or ultimately an extension of the low or a test of the lows and whichever one of those three comes first, that's your potential target. Do keep in mind, obviously, like I mentioned, because we are stopping down rather than initiating down, once the market does find that response after having the flush out, We are likely to see a very aggressive reversal just simply because stop areas do tend to get retested and filled out Okay in terms of risk-reward very high obviously for good reason We are going to be taking a target of at least 50% of the day's range So with a very limited stop it does give us good risk-reward metrics in terms of the application.

So if we get that absorption we enter in once and then just before the break below that consolidatory zone as we spoke about an example we add on the second leveraged position. Okay a tip use color lines for key breakouts okay because this is a patient trade strategy you know it might come later on in the session you might be a little bit switched off. not recognizing what had happened earlier in the session and you might miss out on this opportunity so it's one of those where the color lines can be really helpful and remember a key breakout can ultimately reverse.
