So note that the template is broken up into four major sections. The first will be the value area placement. So where the value area is trading relative, in relative to the previous day and maybe Then, the template will talk about the attempted direction, so where we open, where we close and where is value being accepted, so just giving us a little bit of a relative understanding about the attempted direction and who's in control. We'll then talk, or the template will then show us and talk about profile shape, you know, have we got symmetry or non-symmetry, have we got balance or no balance, are we trending or not trending, and are we, you know, sort of showing bracketing or trending type markets. And then volume, our template will show us a little bit about relative volume, relative ranges and all sorts of relative statistics that we can utilize. So with these four major pillars, let's not go into the template, let's get up a basic example, let's complete this template together so you can get a better understanding of what we've dealt with so far in module 1 and module 2.", "transcript": "It's that time now where we can finally put... everything we've learned so far in Module 1 and Module 2 into a very concise template that we can complete on a day-to-day basis and even on the weekend.
