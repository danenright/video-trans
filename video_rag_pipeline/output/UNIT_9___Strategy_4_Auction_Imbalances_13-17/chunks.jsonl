Don't forget, obviously we did speak about, you know, I know we have said the initial variation of, you know, the extension and the potential retest before, or the pull back and then retest, but we then did speak about filling out the balance as well and, you know, scalping it on both sides. Again, it's not necessary that you have to take on all three variations or try all three strategies, it's there for you to observe, try, see if you're willing to adopt it, see if you want to take on some of those scalps. Like I said in the unit, when we spoke about the elephant or hiding behind the elephant, traders don't necessarily take on these little scalps because we want to hold it for big winners. We simply do it because we can neck ticks with a very high degree of certainty. Okay. In terms of volatility then, it will be seemingly high. Now, this is where you've got to be cautious, as we mentioned. Sometimes it can seem volatile, simply because price moves quite aggressively, but it doesn't necessarily mean it is an aggressive directional movement. That's where we focused heavily on, not just the volume, but also the delta coloring. Okay, let's now move on to the strategy identification. So then in terms of obviously identifying the patterns don't forget obviously we use nice bright green lines We did highlight obviously how to have an imbalanced chart and how you could easily see them with an imbalanced shot or Usual charts, but you would require you know being more observant of the price of the lots traded each price So firstly in terms of obviously interaction note we spoke about the initiative being taken hence the imbalance now note it's initiative only in high volume okay high volume is initiative whereas low volume it could be considered initiative but it's very low volume initiative which is sometimes reflective maybe a little bit of stop up maybe a little bit of a speculative type move which more often than not is going to reverse. In terms of the interaction, it's quite aggressive in nature, looks very aggressive on the ladder as well as on the footprint.

In terms of the Delta, obviously we do have high-volume and low-volume Deltas and I showed you how to see that with the Delta shading. and obviously then in cumulative delta not really relevant in terms of the strategy it is a little bit of a shorter term time frame strategy but you do expect it to go in this high volume you know initiative being taken and we see these imbalances you do expect the cumulative delta to go with the trend or in the direction of the trend and then obviously note in terms of relative changes we will see a shift in the volume price delta particularly as the high volume you know the But note, obviously when we have low volume imbalances, you might not see these relative shifts. So again, you can lean on those relative shifts to identify is it a low volume auction imbalance or is it a high volume auction imbalance. Okay, let's move on then to the execution part of the template. In terms of obviously then the execution side, starting with the money management, note obviously we've got, depending on the variation you're taking, you can afford to be a little more passive in terms of entry. Why? Because once we get that a bit of initiative and the imbalance created, we do want to wait for the market to come back. So we will get a fill passively and note once we see that absorption ahead of the imbalance, that's where we're somewhere within the imbalance note. If the imbalance does begin the process of filling out, it's likely to trade both sides of the imbalance, hence why we stop out within the imbalance. Note, obviously, in terms of target, when there's higher volume, we obviously have higher potential targets, because we could see, obviously, at least a retest of the extreme. or even an extension of that extreme. So again, this is where context will be quite crucial. And again, also another really good example why I don't like to give targets. I really despise this idea of, you know, where should I get out? Where should I take profit? Okay, this is something you will learn through time. You'll learn where best is to take profits and where best is to place your stops.

Well, let's get caught up in the price action. This is something that's crucial But when there's a bit of volatility on price ladders professional traders have a very bad a very bad habit of getting sucked into the ladder, getting sucked into what we call the Vegas lights. And the Vegas lights are simply that when the price is moving around quite a lot, you assume there's opportunity. That isn't the case. Volatility does not necessarily mean opportunity. It just means a greater variance of prices. So whilst most traders are not identifying the imbalance, you have identified it. You're not getting caught up in the price ladder, but you're executing exactly where you want to and ultimately taking advantage Okay, let's now move on to, hands down, one of my favorite books within the reading, within the additional reading section. Now if you haven't heard about this book, put it on Amazon straight away, Tim Ferriss' An amazing book. He's actually just released another one another book. That's come out very similar Well, this whole book goes about very simply just very briefly some Ferris practical application Author through personal experiences. So he takes his own personal experiences He adopts the habits and the approaches of other people who tries them out and then gives his opinion on him Okay, he elaborates on him. That's pretty much the whole book goes about in terms of summary You effectively learned from 200 masters across all industries, whether it's health, sports, science, life, it doesn't matter. So 200 people at the top of their game, they share with you their characteristics, their habits, the things they do, you know, some of their thoughts, some of their best guidance. They share all this with you and that's what this book's about. It's a summarized version of two of the best, 200 of the best performing, whatever you want to call them, performers in the world.

Make sure you get this on your reading list as it's incredibly valuable. Alright, let's go wrap up now with our drill section. So practice does make perfect. We're at the drill session again. As you know by now, watch the drill, complete your template, watch the drill with the guided tuition, make adjustments to your template. When you're comfortable, go back and watch some of the videos within the unit, again make another template. When you're happy that you understand the strategy and you're ready to move on, then do so. Alright, this then concludes now at unit 9 and this is obviously now a fourth strategy we finished We have got another six to come so hang tight And obviously as Aristotle said we are what we repeatedly do excellence. Therefore is not an act but a habit Okay, so you are repeatedly what you do. So doing this template every single time and doing it you know maybe three times a day at the end of every strategy session and then maybe doing it over a course of a month 90 times and doing it over a course of 12 months suddenly you're going to form an incredible habit of completing a template okay and ultimately you will become excellent at it.
