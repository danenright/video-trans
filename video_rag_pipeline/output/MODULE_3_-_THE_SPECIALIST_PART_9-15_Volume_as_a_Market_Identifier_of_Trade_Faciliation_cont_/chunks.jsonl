So firstly, volume is the most reliable indicator of the market's ability to facilitate trade. Remember, an auction process is all about how buyers are interacting with one another. Now the amount of transaction taking place tells us a lot about how buyers and sellers are interpreting where price is trading, and that is why we pay key attention to Then, a market that is not facilitating trade will not survive long. So if for instance we look at a lot of the property markets around the world, if all of a sudden at these very very high prices that property is transacting at, suddenly buyers are no longer interested and momentum starts to slow and we stop seeing prices move higher, eventually some sellers are going to step in and take profits, they're If, as prices go lower, we cannot see buyers stepping in to facilitate trade, the market will keep moving lower until it finds that point where buyers feel property prices are at a discount. So again, the basic example of property is no different to the basic ideas we see in the markets day to day. They are all markets, they all have the same auction process and the same interaction between buyers and sellers and the way they respond. Then, all markets seek to trade at price levels that maximize volume. In other words, the market always wants to be trading at fair value. Why? Because this is the point at which trade facilitation is maximized. or more importantly, this is the point at which buyers and sellers are finally meeting each other and can execute their various orders without having too much of a concern of price moving quickly away from them. So again, when a market manages to find fair value, yes it's frustrating for us as traders, but the market is then technically actually doing its function or its job of facilitating trade well. Now, as a basic premise, you know, high volume would intend to imply that trade is being facilitated well, whereas low volume trade is not necessarily being facilitated well and will not continue for long. So again, that sentence on its own doesn't make much sense, but what do I mean by that? This is not a move we want to fade, this is not a move we want to employ any kind of reversal-type strategies. Rather, we want to be looking for momentum-type strategies. Whereas the converse, if a market is moving on relatively high volume, but the market's moving between a series of prices and accepting value, this is something where we want to be looking to employ reversal type strategies or any kind of a nominalist type strategies", "transcript": "Let's take a look at some of the principles now of volume.

So, if there is low volume and prices are moving quite aggressively in one direction leaving all sorts of anomalies like low volume areas, a couple of ledges and a couple of other anomalies, well there's a high probability that these anomalies are going to be filled at some point. So again, we employ the various strategies accordingly and we will talk a lot more Then, low or decreasing volume in static price increases the probability for a market to And lastly, the dispersion of volume of a profile will show areas of control.
