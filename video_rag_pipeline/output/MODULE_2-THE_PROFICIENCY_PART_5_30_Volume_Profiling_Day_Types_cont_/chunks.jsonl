What you have here effectively is on the x axis you've got basically the six different day types that you can expect to see on any given day. In other words, the amount of bias, or not necessarily bias, but how confident you can be in the market holding the initial move, whether it's to the upside or to the downside. Remember what I said to you earlier. If you knew that there was a 60 or 70 or 80% chance that a market was likely to keep going higher all day or keep going lower, these odds greatly impact the types of strategies you're going to take and that's why we want to know where the market has the lowest amount of Now it's important for me to, I'm going to start on the highest amount of conviction and talk about the two trend day types. As you can see the traditional trend has got the most amount of conviction and this is obvious because we see the one time frame controlling the entire session whether that's to the upside or to the downside. So we know that momentum strategies or flow strategies or breakout strategies will work Next to that we have the double distribution trend day. Remember, the double distribution only holds so long as the low volume area or single prints remain intact. We then have the neutral extreme day. Remember, this is the day type where the market trades on both sides of the initial balance but closes relatively aggressive on the high or the low. That close gives us an early indicator for activity the next morning. We then have the normal variation day. This is the day type where we have a very, very wide initial balance. Now the reason we have a high level of conviction here is because we know there's a high probability we're likely to spend the day filling out that initial overnight trading session. We then have the neutral day type. Then we have the normal day, gain even less convection, and then we have the non-trend day. So as you can see, it's important to understand the level of conviction in the market move as this will sort of effectively give you a lot of confidence when you're taking on various strategies over the period of a day.
