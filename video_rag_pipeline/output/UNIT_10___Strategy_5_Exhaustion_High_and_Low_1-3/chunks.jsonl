This is Challenge Day 17 of 30. In the following slide, we are going to focus on the art of recovery from poor performance. The focus will be on how to develop recovery skills over time. The purpose of me going through this is I'm gonna give you three step-for-step processes on how you can develop your own recovery skills. So think of this as drills. Okay, this is the drills I'm giving you, just like a Jordan Smith has drills. This is your drill set that you have to go practice if you want to become better at recovery. Okay, the first one, you have to learn emotional control, right? The only way you're ever going to become better at recovery is emotional control. Right, now the first thing to do is to understand that you can recover, okay? Most people don't think you can. Most people, the minute they take the loss, they accept the loss and, you know, So failing, you know, to acknowledge that you can recover, that's one step you need to get over. Now, in terms of emotional control, what you need to be able to do is the minute you've taken a big hit, the minute you've lost a big chunk of money, you're close to stop. You need to walk away. You need to have that strength to stand up and walk away, okay? Take that five minutes, take that 15 minutes, because what you will notice is that very often if you do not walk away, you're gonna end up digging that deep. You're gonna end up digging that hole a lot deeper, okay? You're gonna end up losing more, but you're gonna end up also being in a mental negative state, okay? By sitting there, even if you don't do anything, you're not getting out of your mental state that you're currently stuck in, okay? So the next time you need to recover, step number one, get up and walk away for 15 minutes. Okay, go through in those 15 minutes go through in your head the honest reasons Why what happened happened and you're gonna find 90% of the time they were in your control Okay, whether it was a big loss. Maybe you moved to stop Maybe you you know kind of got into a trade because some guy on Twitter said get into a trade Whatever it may be write it down put it down on a piece of paper take ownership All right, because once you take ownership of that, you know, whatever calls you to take a big loss You're gonna let go of it Okay, it's almost like if I said to you, you know, okay, today's loss, you know, it happened with something that's in your control. By acknowledging that it's in your control, that means you can avoid doing it next time. Okay, all of a sudden you're going to feel that burden on your shoulders lift off. So that's why we do it.

That's why step Now I need to move on. Now I need to get back into that mental state and move on. And that's where professional golfers are so good. Okay, they can hit one bad shot and literally six, seven minutes later, they're back to square one. Okay, all they're focused on is not what has been or what will become. They're focused on what is the now. And that's the key to step number one, emotional control. Step number two is self belief. Now a lot of people say yes I've got self-belief, I believe and but okay that's not enough so I'm going to give you another process to develop your self-belief and it's called an opportunity sheet. Now at the end of every single day my trading day what I do is I go and write down in my debrief all the opportunities that were there in the day across whatever markets In general, on average, in a normal trading day, all things being equal, you're looking at between five and eight unique tradable opportunities. Opportunities that I could have executed and made good money because I understand the setup and the management and all that sort of thing. Now imagine if I said to you, if you look at your trading sheet at the end of the week or your debriefs, and you go and you see that over a course of the week there were 40 opportunities that you could have made money. Okay, because the minute you have this opportunity sheet, right, I know fine well that bang, I've lost money, but guess what? I know on average there's going to be five to eight unique opportunities today. So guess what? I may only have had two. That means I'm likely to see three to five more opportunities. Hey, what's all the fuss about? Why am I so upset? Okay, because guess what? I'm gonna have the opportunity to get it back. that's the key to the opportunity sheet. By having the opportunity sheet you have belief that if you were to execute in the right frame of mind you will get that money back and that's the key to the opportunity sheet. Try it out this week. The last one you need a realistic approach okay and this includes clip management. Now for me in general when I take a big hit and I need to recover I start slow. Okay, why well because there is no point in me testing my emotional ability I know how I respond when I'm a long way down, okay So what I tend to do if I'm used to risking say a thousand dollars per trade I'm now going to risk two hundred and fifty dollars per trade. Okay, so I'm gonna cut my clip I'm gonna reduce the amount I'm risking per trade Why because my objective needs to be realistic and realistically all I need to do on that first trade is make a damn Winner, that's all Equally, I need to execute that first trade as if nothing else had happened.", "transcript": "with something that's in your control.
