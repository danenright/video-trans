So that's on slide 3 and the particular section we'll be focusing on spoofing and the layering and flipping. Then slide 4, just an overview structure of the module. Then slide 5 to 6, we start defining what is spoofing, layering and flipping. we look at how it's all about intent in prosecuting the spoofing and then slide nine really the actual the legal Dodd-Frank paper and we'll just be covering that very very briefly and then we start looking at what is layering on slide 10, what is flipping on slide 11, then slide 12 to 15. We look at training strategies around spoofs and flippers and then we actually look at a video on executing training strategies on observing these particular patterns. And then like we always do in the final slide in order to consolidate the learning, we do live drill practice. We have an organized worksheet for you to really have a dedicated practice to improving your skill set price ladder patterns in the market.", "transcript": "Okay, like we always do at each part of our modules We look at the approach and the various sections that we'll be covering in this module Firstly in slide 3 we'll be looking at our methodical framework on how we are structuring the learning.
