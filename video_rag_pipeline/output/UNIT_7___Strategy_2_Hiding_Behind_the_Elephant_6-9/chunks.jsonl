We obviously have a stop below the previous extreme and we're looking for a reversal in the opposite direction. Now note, obviously this is in terms of risk-reward. This is not gonna be the highest risk-reward trade strategy you're gonna get. You're simply just looking for a little flush in the opposite direction. Why, you may ask. Well, it's very simple. We know that, by definition, we've now left a bad high and low. Therefore, that low is quite vulnerable, in which case we don't wanna be looking In that case, our second variation is actually the break of hiding behind the elephant. So if we recognize the hiding behind the elephant, once we do start to turn over and we do get below, for the second time we get below that elephant, we are simply looking to sell for a continuation in the direction of the trend. Okay those are two variations then and those are our principles applied. Now let's go have a look at some of the examples on the footprint so we can get a better understanding of what it looks like. Okay so our first example is in the e-mini S&P. and as you can see it's quite an obvious elephant. We break below we can see a nice little double bottom below. This was taken from the 19th of December. It is also a rotational chart. Bear in mind these elephants you can see equally good on a time based or a rotational based.

Probably not I think the next best is 7,000 over there Maybe 6,000 so almost double the amount of volume and that's you know If you want to learn this trade strategy and be really good at scalping the elephant You need to first identify what is relatively high volume just observing it and noting it. Step one is obviously noting the elephant. Step two letting the elephant be take out and once we get back above that elephant we want to then look to be a buyer at one of the four prices. Okay we can see obviously the market does give us a fill at 87.25, comes back a second time gives us a fill there, comes back a third time and even comes back a fourth time. Okay so it does give you multiple opportunities. Do note Like we said, what we do not want to see is we do not want to see the market going below the elephant. So in this instance, obviously, we would have most likely been taking profit on one of these three rotations. Time is quite an important factor here. Obviously because we're expecting initiative in the opposite direction, it shouldn't be taking that long. So what I would say, if this was a normal example and you weren't out, you would have most likely stopped out at that point. Okay so that's our first example of a hiding behind the elephant. Now let's look at an example of another one in the oil market. Okay so this is taken from the 20th of November in the oil. Again note the elephant and I'm going to show you a practical example of this in a minute. You're going to see what it looks like, how quick it is but that's the iceberg order. Again know what is relatively large volume. Okay 2,100 contracts is extremely large volume Note how the market obviously comes down, it has a look below the elephant, comes back above the elephant, gives us the full opportunity. But note in this example, notice how the market obviously does go back below the elephant and this is what made this very very tricky because it ultimately did go back below the elephant. Some of the traders would choose to have the stop below the low. For me I prefer to keep it much tighter so I'd like to keep it once it goes back but I would like to keep it pretty much around where the base of that elephant is. What I will say as a general rule of thumb when the market does come back off at a second time and retest the elephant you want to see some speed reversal away from it okay if you see that speed reversal in that instance you know you want to ultimately be placing your stop below the elephant what made this tricky was ultimately it was the very next rotation in which we came and tested it so I think that's what made it tricky in this example but ultimately we can see that the Okay, just in terms of basic observations, obviously we do note the very aggressive volume,", "transcript": "But if we just do a basic comparison, can you see 13,000 contracts traded anywhere else on this page?

Okay, now let's look at Let's look at some one more example before we move on to the practical examples So ultimately again what we can see this was a taken from the 14th of November Probably not the greatest example and I'll explain to why okay What had happened was and again, this is why relative volume is so important and why focusing on the Delta so important So again, you know some might argue that you know 600 is quite a large reload order But ultimately if you get the if you if you don't identify what is large volume or not Okay, you're not going to become very successful at this trade strategy. So I've put this example. It's just a random example I've taken from the oil, but what we can see is that it did come back it retested this really dark amount of volume traded and then continued to sell off. However, this is not an elephant. Why? Because an elephant needs to be at least bigger than one price. That's the first thing. And second, you need relatively high volume. So that's the two real key takeaways from this chart. Just make sure you learn and differentiate between the two. One thing I do want to point out be very cautious. Okay, be very very cautious Trading this strategy in roll week. Okay. In fact, don't even bother with this trade strategy Why because contracts are rolling you're gonna see a lot of Potential elephants and a lot of them are actually not elephants. They just simply roll. So just bear that in mind also things like OpEx Things like month end be cautious trading them So as I mentioned you're gonna find this is extremes at the break of extremes And you will see this as we go through examples. You will see what this looks like on the ladder in a minute In terms of entry, I think the best thing to do is to go back to the previous example as I mentioned We're looking for an entry point somewhere within that original Elephant and with a stop either below the elephant or below the previous low Okay, let's now go and have a look at two of the practical examples and see what they look like Okay, so let's take a look at an example of the elephant what you can see in front of you on the screen Between price point 80 80 182 we can see a real aggressive relative amount of volume being traded", "transcript": "stop below the elephant what made this tricky was ultimately it was the very next rotation in which we came and tested it so I think that's what made it tricky in this example but ultimately we can see that the Okay, just in terms of basic observations, obviously we do note the very aggressive volume, the real pickup in volume, and delta, and ultimately the cumulative delta on the day.

Now obviously I mentioned in terms of stop, either you want it just below the elephant So again, if you're looking for a 20 tick target, you could probably afford to take maybe a 6 tick stop Whereas if you're only looking for say a 5-6 tick target, you might want to keep your target a little bit tighter Okay, so we can see obviously the markets now come back above those 80 ones And again, what you're going to see now as we can see on the price ladder as well But you can see now how the markets gone from being aggressively selling to suddenly more of an initiative in the the opposite direction okay notes obviously in terms of execution what we're looking for is we're looking for a retest of the elephant once the elephant is retested as we can see here add all the way down to 80s okay this would have been a good opportunity 80 ones note the absorption okay so if you want to get a one lot or a 10 lot away you'll easily be able to get filled in there note the market did break below but ultimately did come back but now we spoke about the second variation of the strategy what you would expect to see again this is where you know again I try to give you guys many variations but always try to give you caution if you gonna go with the two variations you would have been a seller below 80's looking for continuation with a tight stop you know so maybe somewhere around 85's if you believe firmly in the elephant ultimately you'd still be long with a stop it all depends on the variation you're applying.

Obviously we can see the second time we came back above the elephant, the marker then rotated quite nicely towards the upside and ultimately we eventually went and filled out the imbalance to the upside. Okay, now we see one last thing do note the bad low We will talk about this strategy a little bit later on, but you know the bad low there You can see the markets traded almost you know 200 odd 229 contracts or more more more like 260 or 275 apologies and Bad low so we know there's a high probability for that to be taken out later on okay, so that's our first example now The second example is what happens when we get it wrong? What happens when we don't identify an elephant and we simply just getting sucked in remember? I said the rules you do want to see obviously at least more than one Amount of absorption you need to know what is high relative absorption, so I'm just going to show you the example Of the picture we saw So what you're going to see now is the market comes down to the 600 lot I want you to see how the 600 lot trades What you can see is on the price ladder. It is one order. Okay, so we can see on the price that here It was just simply one order wanting liquidity there It wasn't an elephant per se why because an elephant or an iceberg will tend to not show the whole order he will ultimately tend to look to He'll ultimately tend to look to fill it up, you know and not show the market the entire order Okay, so we can see obviously, you know, the orders all got filled on the way down, market came back up and then the market continued low. So this is again what the elephant doesn't look like and I think that's the importance of showing this video. Just make sure that you follow the rules for identifying and observing an elephant.
