The first and most important action plan or the step in the action plan is to understand the power of a consistent approach, okay? Now, This is a bit like religion, most people struggle with the concept of religion and the concept of faith simply because they kind of want to see a result on this. They want to see, if I was religious, what would all the great things be like? What would all these wonderful things appear like? They want tangible almost, okay? it's the same with this with the art of consistency right you have to believe in the actual process you have to believe and understand that through a consistent approach ultimately you're going to get rewarded at the end okay now you would have only seen this if you've actually ever stuck to a consistent approach and I'm going to share a really nice example with you tonight something that I've gone through personally and hopefully you can you know not just sort of take away The first thing to understanding the power of a consistent approach is to understand the definition of what consistency means okay. Now obviously I've got the textbook definition here but the only real you know sort of parts I actually like to this uh you know is the I really like this the lack of deviation and the lack of change okay that is the key success and the key understanding behind consistency is there is no change you have a plan you stick to it you go through it doesn't matter high or how it doesn't matter what happens along the okay and there's no deviation there's no ifs and buts and changes that is if you can stick to those things a lack of change and a lack of deviation ultimately you're going to have achieved a consistent approach okay so the second step in order you know on the process to getting more consistent all right is you need to set a big picture goal right now i'm not talking about you know in in one year's time i want to be a millionaire Okay, it's a simple goal and the example I'm going to use when I move on to the next slide as I'll show you here is the goal of a half iron man. Okay, it's no secret a lot of you have been following me for a while, you know I'm training for a half iron man and I'm relating to this training I'm going through to developing a consistent plan. Okay, so Set the big-picture goal. What is it ultimately? Where do you want to be 12 months from now? Where do you want to be a year from now?

Okay, so Set the big-picture goal. What is it ultimately? Where do you want to be 12 months from now? Where do you want to be a year from now? What is it that you're trying to achieve? Okay, make that goal nice and simple nice and objective nice and easy to understand. What is it? Okay, write it down on a big piece of paper and stick it up on the wall So, you know where you're ultimately heading toward then and this is where the key comes in you need an exact action plan Okay, now for me with regards to this half iron man, it's pretty straightforward. I've got a training program The training program has been developed for me. I simply follow it I know exactly how long my program is. I know what time i'm committing to the program I know the place and I know the activity. There's there's very little I can deviate deviate from this plan Why because it's an exact plan, right? The plan is is simply like following a recipe It's a step-for-step process. Okay, you need to do the same thing in your trading. You have to set out an exact action plan now that can be an action plan of routine that can be an action plan of you know just simply you know being able to do a debrief at the end of every single session for three months okay but set an exact action plan with the time the place and activity and don't allow for any deviations remember the lack of change and the lack of deviation is what consistency is all about accountability. You need to determine and find some way to make yourself accountable to this exact action plan. Okay, now again, obviously in the example of the Iron Man, you know, I've got constant reminders. So every day I get this little buzzing in my email, my phone buzzes and it says, hey, you've got to go train now, okay, there's no excuses. Now there's a number of different things you can use. You can use things like alarms, you've got all sorts of apps nowadays, technology. You can have a partner, someone that you're accountable to. OK, so like with training, like with trading, make yourself accountable in one way or another. Again, guys, what I'm trying to do is relate it to you. I want you to take each one of these, the accountability, the exact plan, the big picture, the understanding, and I want you to apply them to your individual situation. It doesn't matter if you're a trader. It doesn't matter if you're an accountant. It doesn't matter. The steps to become consistent are the same. Make sure that you set... Simple, small, achievable steps every single day. This is the number one step in the action plan that almost 90% of people fail, including myself. I've failed with action plans probably so many times in my life I cannot begin to tell you. It's only now that I've been on the other side that I've seen an approach that works that I'm able to relate this to you. Okay, it's not complicated.

Don't over commit All right It's that over commitment that when you fail to achieve that you lose motivation You drop off and ultimately the action plan, you know falls away Okay, so that's the next step don't overachieve you don't want to be an overachieve consistency is not about overachievement Okay, that's a fallacy that again, you know you look at for instance You know these these YouTube videos and you know these sportsmen on the television you think wow these guys are overachievers I'm gonna have to go out and overachieve now to become like them. No If they followed the exact same action plan that I'm showing you, they started with simple small achievable steps. Over time, they were able to overachieve as a result of having an action plan toward consistency. Don't overtrain. And again, this is related to training, but this is trading. You do not want to be sitting on a trading floor 14 hours a day. You can only realistically be focused for seven, eight hours a day. So just accept that every day you can only do so much. Don't overachieve, don't over train and never over commit. Don't come out saying bang seven days a week I'm going to focus on my trading, I'm going to spend an hour every single day because ultimately it's not going to work in the long run. You need the balance, you need the ability to get away and experience and enjoy life. Don't overachieve, don't over train and don't over commit. Then create the feedback loop. This is so crucial. You need that feedback loop that's constantly coming to you saying, you know, well done, excellent, you did this. Well done, excellent, you did this. Well done, excellent, you did this. You're progressing, you're progressing, you're progressing. You're achieving, you're achieving, you're achieving. Okay, you need that constant feedback loop that's giving you an overall summary of one way you started, one way you're headed and how you're getting there, the steps you're taking. It's that feedback loop that gives you the motivation, it's that feedback loop that's constantly telling you, you know what, actually, shit, you know, I'm starting to feel a bit of consistency coming, I'm actually starting to feel good about this, you know, wow, I'm starting to feel strong, I'm starting to feel like this is really working. And that, when you start to feel that little bit of a positive feedback loop, that is what drives you to take it a step up and ultimately, you know, get towards where you want to be. Then set the motivational cues now so crucial along the way They're gonna be points in time where you just cannot be asked.

Then another good one is obviously the before and after. You see a lot of people doing this with regards to weight loss. Take that picture on day one. Measure yourself on day one. You know make sure you know where you've come because you never ever want to go back there again. Okay that's what the motivational cue is about. It's so you can lean on it when push the boundaries within each effort. Now, this is the beauty of this little simple step, okay? When you're doing simple, small, achievable steps every day, you start to get this little bit of a feeling, okay? And I felt this personally in my training. You get this feeling that actually, I'm not doing enough today, but actually you are doing enough. And the fact that you feel that you're not doing enough, that's the time to take a step up and push as hard as you can within those small achievable steps that you're taking every day. Because it's when you step out of that boundary within each one of those efforts that you're experiencing real growth. But you're doing it within a smart action plan. Last one, don't change the game plan. Remember. It's the lack of deviation, the lack of change. Don't change the game plan just because it comes tough, just because suddenly you know there's a speed bump in the road, just because things become tough. Don't change the game plan. It doesn't matter if it's week one, week two, or week 13. Don't change the plan until you get to the end because if you can survive and get to the end, you are going to finally, for the first time in your lives, experience consistency.

Well, I'm going back to square one Make the commitment small little steps and you will ultimately start to develop Consistency, okay Consistency I will tell you not just in trading but in life Consistency is probably one of the characteristics or the skill sets that very few will ever experience, and ever master.
