So we're going to have a brief discussion about this now. It's a very, very important principle that I want to begin to develop with you now, and we're going to develop unique strategies using high volume and low volume strategies as we move particularly along in module three. The first thing to understand is a high-volume node is merely, it's a TPO build-up or a volume build-up at a single... price. So where you see a lot of prices trading or the market trades a lot of volume at one price or trades a lot of times at one price, this is known as a high volume node. And this usually occurs when there is a lack of volatility and hence the market auctions an early identifier of two-way trade within the market auction process. Then a high volume area is exactly the same as a high volume node except it is over a series of prices. The low volume node is the exact opposite. It's where a price has been skipped over and very little trade has been facilitated at that price. This can be identified as a single TPO or a time price observation or a letter in The low volume area again is just a series of prices where there is a low amount of volume traded or quite a few single prints within the profile. Now, a market that has created a low-volume area will usually initially hold this area and facilitate trade above or below the area. It shows that there is an element of control from either the buyers or sellers. Once the low-volume area begins to trade, the effort is negated and typically the low-volume area will be faded out. Now, crucial, crucial, crucial, you understand this, we are going to develop some fantastic A low volume error is a control sort of identifier within the volume profile. Now this control identifier merely gives us that little bit of a sort of not necessarily a bias but a little bit of a focus on either being only a buyer if there's a low volume error from the buy side or only being a seller if there's a low volume error from the sell side. Remember. So long as that low volume area remains we want to continue to go with the direction of the underlying trend. So we are going to pay a lot more attention to low volume areas", "transcript": "We're now going to move on to the final section of part seven, being the high volume areas and low volume areas, as well as volume and TPO ledges.
