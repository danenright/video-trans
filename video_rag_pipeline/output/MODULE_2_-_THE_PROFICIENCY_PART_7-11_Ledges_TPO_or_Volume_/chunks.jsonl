Now remember, a TPO build-up or volume build-up at a single price is a ledge. So in the first example with the pink line, as you can see, there's 4 TPO's, so 4 times the market traded toward this price and couldn't get below this price of 74. So that becomes a TPO build-up or a ledge. Remember what we said, more often than not what you're going to find is that there will be stops triggered in and below that ledge. Now that's why we pay attention to it. What I will point out is this is very much a short-term type trade opportunity. We're looking for stops and then again, remember what we said, if the market does choose to fill out the low volume area, then we could see continuation lower in prices. Ledge now the flip side to that is what we call a volume ledge in the second shot now what you can see is that we also have a kind of a ledge in terms of TPO's over a number of prices, but then also we can see it with the volume in the bars on the right. So that would be a volume ledge as well as a TPO ledge. Now these ledges, they show a build up of two way trade and again once we sort of penetrate past those ledges we then tend to get a little bit of stops and potential for continuation. pay attention to it. Now just note, a ledge defending a low volume area, so like we can see for instance in the first example, we have a ledge defending a low volume area or an untraded area with that large K tail, that presents an opportunity, but note guys, it's very obvious, the naked eye can see that it's quite obvious, and for that reason, once that ledge gets as the market fills out that untraded area. So again, it's not as straightforward as you sell for the stops and it will continue all the way lower. Sometimes it can take almost the entire session to fill out that low volume area. In a high volume area, being defended by a ledge, as in the second example, it's slightly less obvious and therefore more effective. So once we take that ledge to the upside, or sorry, in this example, to the downside, we likely to see maybe a little bit more stops but also a little bit more easier continuation as it's slightly less obvious. Then note, ledges show price pressure, but also an obvious point for exit. So there's a confluence of stops behind the ledge, and by that token, if it's very obvious that there's going to be a lot of stops there, you need to execute very methodically and very mechanically.", "transcript": "So as you can see with the charts provided, the first example is what we call a TPO ledge.

Now, just with regards to high volume and low volume areas, in the first example you can see that long K-tail of untraded low volume nodes. As you can see, the volume is very, very low there, so that is a low volume area relative to the rest of the profile. In the second example you can see what a high volume area is relative to a low volume area. So where all that volume is being dispersed that would be a high volume area and where all the less volume is being dispersed that is regarded as a low volume area.
