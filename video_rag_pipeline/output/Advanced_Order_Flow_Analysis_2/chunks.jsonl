It is Tuesday the 7th of February I hope everyone's had a good day trading and let's get straight into it Today the price action I'm going to be looking at is a spoofing and flipping sort of trade combined with large orders The actual trade is a sort of hit-and-run type of play but like I say I'll kind of you know, these are all these type of strategies and execution plays kind of combined can all merge into one, so as we get into it I'll sort of explain how I see it and how I kind of turn not so good trading into all right trading and how you know you can sometimes make a bad trade sort of work out for you. But anyway let's get into the sort of technical setup of how I approach this trade. First of all you have a daily profile on the left And as you guys can see we have this ledge set up on the profile which we've broken out of basically the setup of the day as we opened at the top end of Monday's range. We pushed higher and we came up to a really good level here and rolled back over again. As we start trading back underneath Monday's high, we're looking for accumulation trade in terms of looking for further downside, looking for this poorly structured value area and profile to be filled out, to be traded through. So that's the understanding of the first initial trade in terms of you're looking for short side, you're looking for initiative shorts in that sense, but on the right this really steep Bollinger band. And just the way that I combine the two things together guys like I was saying, as much as this initial trade is a really good one, the short, that is the technically right trade, that is the right trade to be taking in this time. You're looking for, and as I get into when I show you a lower time frame chart, you're looking reversion back to this really accepted value area traded up here. We still have VPOG up here. We haven't shifted any sense of real value lower down. The volume traded out was relatively low. As much as this is somewhat of an aggressive move, it's a potentially overstretched move. I'm going to show you guys how I initially maximize the short side in terms of you know further you know after say being short and then looking to say make the most out of other opportunities that come about", "transcript": "Good afternoon guys and welcome to this price action debrief.

I'm not what you know I'm expecting some sort of shorts paying up. If this move is to happen, it's quite a flush move. This is the type of price action that I didn't like to see guys. Like I said, when it's a high volume market and it's auctioning two-way really nicely and there's clear buyers and sellers interacting, you shouldn't really see this two-way chop. You have the You have a real clean sort of reaction from price and it would just kind of bounce like, you know, obviously, as much as it's a long sort of, you know, taking initiative, it's short paying up.
