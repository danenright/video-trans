We've come now towards the end of unit 1 and I'm going to just briefly introduce you to the template We're going to be utilizing throughout unit 6 to 15 now before I actually show you the template The important thing is I really want to just drive home You know why we utilize this template and why are we going to spend a lot of time filling it out? And developing your trade strategies on this template now The important thing to understand is what effectively is templating. So all it is, is that... We create this one page, a document, and every single time we have a trade strategy we go and recognize that trade strategy in three different elements. The first is the observation part of the strategy, the second is effectively the identification part of the strategy, and the third is the execution part of the strategy. Now by doing this daily and by doing this every single time you see one of the ten trade strategies, you're going to learn to develop a very specific way of recognising, identifying and executing each one of the 10 trade strategies. So straight away you should be saying to yourself, well, ah, I'm going to develop a habit or a pattern recognition for each one of the trading strategies and that's the key. If there's one objective I'd really like every one of you traders to achieve by the end of this course it's that you're able to not just you know develop your own habits or your own trading templates but to develop a consistent approach or process to your trading. And that's why throughout Unit 6-15, I'm really going to push you and urge you in every one of the challenges to complete this trading template. I'm going to utilize it through every single one of the 10 strategies so you can start to adopt the trading habits that are required to ultimately become consistent. So how the template works, well it's very simple. As you can see, we're gonna start off with selecting the trade strategy. So very basic, you're gonna circle which one of the 10 trade strategies that you saw in the market on that day. You're then going to draw it, you're gonna depict it. And the reason is that, again, humans tend to recognize and remember patterns a lot easier than, say, words or numbers. So I'm just gonna get you to illustrate the pattern the way you recognize the trade strategy. Once you've done that, you're going to start off with the strategy observation. And within that strategy observation, you're going to fill out the characteristics that you defined when recognising that trade strategy. You're then going to move on to the strategy identification.
