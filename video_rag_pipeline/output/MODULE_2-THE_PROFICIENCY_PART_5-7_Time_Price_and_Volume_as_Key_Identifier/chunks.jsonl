It's going to become a lot more practical, you're going to start to see strategies develop and more importantly in your head you're going to start developing various ideas about how you can develop your own strategies just using some of the basic principles I'm going to show you throughout Module 2. Part 5, Time, Price and Volume as a Key Identifier. Now we've been through a lot of this in Module 1 and we've spoken a lot about the three elements that make up the auction. So let's just briefly go over it again, just refresh your mind and make sure you understand the three key elements. So firstly, a volume profile is an entirely objective organisational tool that incorporates indicators generated by an overwhelming number of facts. Now remember what I said to you right in the beginning of module 1. We spoke about how important objectivity was and trying to remove our bias as much as possible. So remember we also spoke and said that the advantages of the volume profile, one of the major advantages, is it allows us to remain objective as you know all the time and that's why volume profiling is so powerful. Then, the volume profile captures the market's fundamental building blocks, which are, as we've mentioned, price, time and volume. And it does this all in one graphic depiction. So we can see all three of these elements in one chart, and this allows us to start developing an understanding of the structure and the nature of the market. Time will regulate each one of these opportunities. Volume measures the degree of success of each auction. The skew of the volume over a number of prices shows the willingness of participants to transact at various prices. Now over the course of this module 2, you're going to start understanding the auction", "transcript": "It's really great to welcome you all back now and I hope you really enjoy Module 2.
