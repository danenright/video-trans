So First, first, foremost, let's just go over the statement, do a little bit of statement analysis, try and pick out what shifted, what changed, what was market moving in the statement from the Bank of England today. So as you can very early on see, the vote to keep QE as well as to keep rates at 25 basis point remained as it was in January at 9-0. So no one on the board was program. However, there was a comment about some policy members are a little closer to their limits of tolerance of an inflation overshoot. So again, we've heard that the Bank of England is willing to accept an inflation overshoot, but they do have a tolerance level. And we actually heard now today that there were two members, or sorry, a few members, some members that were actually getting a lot closer to that level of tolerance. surprise, there are two hawks on the board, their wage growth hawks, so it's very likely that this would have been Kristin Forbes as well as McCafferty and McCafferty. So that's pretty much the hawks sort of getting their sort of stance in the statement. In terms of obviously going forward, obviously the Bank of England said that monetary policy kept that guidance, that forward guidance in the market, you know, they're reluctant to sort of lean the market towards hikes or cuts, so again, they kept that phrase there. And then the major changes in the statement actually came in the Bank of England's forecast of inflation on the two-year horizon and the three-year horizon now. If you cast your mind back into the November QR report, the Bank of England was talking Today they came out and actually lowered that forecast to 2.56, as well as obviously their three-year forecast for inflation came down to 2.36 from 2.5. Now the reason this is key or the reason the actual Carney sort of said the Bank of England made these forecasts was because of the value of sterling and he explicitly in them revising down their inflation forecast. So again, he did make mention that they could adjust these forecasts just as easily if the sterling appreciates or depreciates.", "transcript": "Good afternoon and welcome to the central bank analysis debrief as it was central bank day both yesterday and today We are going to go through one of those central banks being at the Bank of England for Thursday the 2nd of February So let's get straight into it and let's have a little chat about what came out with the Bank of England today.
