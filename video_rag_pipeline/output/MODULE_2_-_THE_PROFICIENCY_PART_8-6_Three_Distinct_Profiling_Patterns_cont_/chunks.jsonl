When we get AP or short covering, it's due to an overextended sell-off and the market has accepted very little value on the way down. So the market's been failing to accept any kind of balance. Now you would typically see, as we spoke about the different phases of a trending initiative move, this would occur toward the backend or the end of the initial phase. probably the weakest shorts would enter the market and that is why we tend to get this short liquidation type move. Note, participants get too short, too fast, we get very little balance, and due to that the market eventually bounces, it runs into very aggressive buyers that are waiting and responding to lower prices, and as a result of prices moving higher, those weak shorts Now note, prices will continue to move higher until such a point as we run into responsive, fresh sellers waiting for higher prices. Now note, there's a high probability that this low is revisited at some point in time. So when we see both short covering patterns as well as long liquidation patterns, that does not necessarily represent a top or a bottom or a big turning point in the market. It's merely the market taking a little bit of a breather, a little bit of profit taking so that the market can just balance out a little bit. and the P-shape profile pattern. So, note, as we said, we first want to see a little bit of acceptance and a little bit of balance, and the high probability trade set up in this case is once the market has prices moved higher and we finally run into responsive sellers that are looking to initiate fresh shorts, that is the point we want to look to initiate short trades with the short term trend. of more about this strategy on the blackboard in later slides.
