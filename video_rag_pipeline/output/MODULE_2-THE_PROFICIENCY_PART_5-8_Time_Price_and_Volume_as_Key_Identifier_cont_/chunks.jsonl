We're going to start off and I'm going to say something that's important to understand Price alone is misleading and I know a lot of sort of the old fashioned way of teaching trading and learning about trading. They teach you to almost solely focus on what price has done, where price has come from and then make decisions about where price might go in the future and focusing on just price on its own, it almost feels like you're missing half of the information. or old business. It's so important to try and understand this. I think there's so few people who actually stop to try and think and interpret why did prices actually go up? Was there new buyers coming into the market, you know, with the continuation of the trend or was this merely shorts being forced out of their short positions and having to buy out of them? Understanding and answering just something as simple as that is going to give you some form of an edge Which time frame is in control? Okay, a lot of the time when we just look at prices going up and down We can't necessarily determine who is it in control at which point? Which direction was the market attempting to move in again a lot of the time? We could see you could sit there the whole day trading the market and it could feel like it's been trying to go up the entire day long Yet at the end of the day it finishes lower. So who was you know, which way was the market trying to go? But who actually won the battle? Okay, again then, the speed of the auction. So important. What do we mean by the speed? In other words, the speed at which the market rotates higher and lower is crucial in interpreting potential future moves for prices. So, volatility, and we're going to talk a lot about volume and volatility later in module 2. But what is volatility? Well, in essence, volatility is just a pick-up or a wider variation around the mean. In other words, prices move a lot more in relative terms than they have been over a period of time. So, volatility is merely just a pick-up in the way or in the speed at which prices Now note, volatility does not imply a pick-up in volume. Important to understand, a pick-up in volume or a lack of liquidity does not imply volatility. Very important you understand that. Then which way is the auction going? Is it a one-way auction or is it a two-way auction? And now note, we're going to talk a lot about auctions quite extensively over the rest of module two. Then volume, one of our key pillars and one of our key identifiers. Volume determines whether or not divergences from value can be sustained. What do we mean by that?", "transcript": "We're going to throw in a few more elements now into the concept of time, price and volume.

The market, or the mere fact that the market is accepting value, suggests that there is not much inclination from either buyers or sellers to take prices higher So, by that token, some days buyers and sellers can be discouraged from moving away from Fair Value. Why? Because there's very little information, data, fundamentals that justifies them taking on the additional risk. But on other days we see price move away from value and this attracts a high interest in the form of higher volume and volatility.
