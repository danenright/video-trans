So let's look at the very key elements of what the charts don't show you. Firstly, the charts do not show you the underlying intention of the market and the true activity. Now, why is that? Because you're not seeing the interaction of orders at key critical levels that you observed on your chart. And it's that underlying intention and intention really being described by, which we'll discuss later on in the next couple of modules, the exchange of orders going through, the auctioning activity, how fast the orders are going through or how slow they're going through key level or a specific juncture point that can really unravel the market.
