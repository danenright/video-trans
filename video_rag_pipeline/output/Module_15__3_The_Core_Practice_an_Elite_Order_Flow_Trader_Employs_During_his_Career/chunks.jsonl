Firstly, screen time. There is nothing better than screen time, but deliberate screen time. There's the old famous rule of 10,000 hours in order to become an elite performer in a particular chosen field. But 10,000 hours can be reduced to 5,000 hours, can be reduced to 3,000 hours. The reason why is you have to make sure that that screen time has a core focus, has a deliberate intention, a deliberate practice. with no core focus, with no objective in mind, it's gonna be 10,000 wasted hours. So make sure each one of those seconds or one of those minutes that build up towards the 10,000 hours has a key objective. So really, really important. And as an example, you can imagine if you're trying to practice specific type of a trend plays. any day that you've observed a trend play and you've traded it really badly, go back, look at the recordings of the video, make your observations so when you're next encountering a trend play, when the market is moving aggressively and the volume and the velocity is very high, make sure you watch that video again and also recall your memory of how the market actually traded and whilst you're doing that, make your notes not only physically on But in your conscious memory, because when you face that situation again, you've now incorporated and solidified that practice. So really important is screen time. I cannot stress the traders who spend time with their screens are the traders that have a greater chance of success. And make sure it's a core focus, you know, three hours in the morning and three hours in the afternoon without any distractions. Next is conscientious practice for every trading session. You know, you see some traders that come into a trading Floor and they sit they get distracted. They want to do a couple of tweets They want to engage a couple of Skype conversations and their practice is all broken up So there isn't that conscientious practice during that session that is your focus. It's watching the ladder, it's watching the screen, having your road map and your data points that you're ready to trade for the day. These are all very important considerations and if you don't incorporate this again you're wasting your 10 000 hour development curve. Next and most importantly with this age of digital distraction, monitor levels of distraction in your core focus. I see so many young traders who are now part of this so-called, you know... digital social world which is a great learning environment but a highly distractive environment if you're trying to develop a skill set. You know you have your phone that is", "transcript": "Okay, the next couple of slides are going to be focusing on the core practices an elite order flow trader employs during his career.
