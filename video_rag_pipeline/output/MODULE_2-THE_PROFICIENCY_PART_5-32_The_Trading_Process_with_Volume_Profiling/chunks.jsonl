And we've spoken about this a little bit earlier in module 1 and we spoke about how you'd go about utilizing volume profiling. Now I'm going to give you almost just an understanding of the purpose as to why we use volume profiling. or a little bit of trading logic and a little bit of understanding or instinct. Now this instinct, or you can almost call it subjective understanding, it's important in order to execute a trade. You have to then have some form of structure or objective understanding and this is where the volume profile is absolutely crucial. We use the volume profile to confirm and bolster our confidence about our understanding. So let's take for example that we Have a trend a trend day and you know We we can see that the markets trying to move up quite aggressively We need to you know before we can just execute and hit the market and be aggressive we need to see some form of understanding whether it's and maybe a low volume area or a very aggressive initiative being taken or maybe You know the markets not respecting any previous pivots from previous day. We need to see these this objectivity before we can take on our trading logic or our subjective understanding of the market. Once we have that structure, time is then very crucial and we're going to talk about the elements of time in some detail but the basic essence of time is that time regulates an opportunity. Now I've never really gone beyond telling you it regulates the opportunity so what Well, for instance, let's say that we identify a day type as being a trending day type. Now note, in a trending day type we know that a market should see constant initiative all day long and we should form lots of little distributions as prices move higher and higher and higher. However, if we know by logic that we should move higher and higher over the period When we start spending too much time within one little distribution, all of a sudden time is telling us that the likelihood of a normal traditional trend day is diminishing. And that is how time regulates each one of the opportunities we take. Another very good example of where time is crucial. If we are looking for an inside daybreak as we've spoken about in previous examples, we know that we expect to see quite a bit of initiative and follow through once we take", "transcript": "We're now going to finish off part 5 of module 2 and just talk a little bit about the trading process with volume profiling.

That is why time is crucial because it allows us to not just, you know, manage our positioning but it allows us almost a benchmark in which we can measure our expectations. Note, one last thing, markets tend to give various amounts of information. I have a little bit of a saying, if something is very obvious to the naked eye and everyone The probability of success is a lot lower, and that's what we're trying to say here. The more obvious or the more information that the market is showing you, the less likelihood there is of success and thus diminishing returns. In other words, if you're seeing a lot of information, if it's becoming more and more obvious, the probability or the likelihood of continuation to profit is becoming less Important you understand that because what volume profiling will teach you to do is almost be slightly ahead of the curve, almost be at the front end of receiving information so that you can take advantage of the opportunity before it starts to show too much information.
