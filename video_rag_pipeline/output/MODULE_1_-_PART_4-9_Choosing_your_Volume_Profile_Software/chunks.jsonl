Now, there's loads of options out there with regards to choosing your volume profile vendor. What I would say the important thing to determine is what it is that you need, what it is that's going to provide value to you as a tool and then look at what the relative prices are. So what I'm going to provide you with is a basic five options that you could pick from to use different volume profiles. What I've done is I've broken it down into six different key characteristics that I think are important for any trader when looking for volume profile software. The first is ease of use. Now as you can see I've done it in stars. Five stars signals very easy to use, very simplistic, very straightforward. Whereas 1 star or 0 stars means extremely difficult or not easy at all. As you can see trading technology is by far one of the easiest charting packages to use. We then have Sierra Charts, Markit Delta Charts, CQG and Investor RT. We then move on to data feed reliability, so crucial guys, do not go cheap on data feed reliability. When it comes to looking at particularly volume and you know specific very important trade setups we need to ensure that our data is accurate. We cannot afford to have inaccurate data as we're going to be risking quite a lot of dollars on you know taking various trade strategies on. So make sure you don't cheap on the data feed reliability. Again as you can see Trading Technologies gets a 4. We then see the likes of Market Delta and CQG that are extremely reliable. The reason is both Market Delta uses an external source so that it will be, they use external source for their data and CQG which is pretty much the industry standard for traders. Whilst more expensive, it does have extremely reliable data feed. In terms of cost effective, again, highly important, if you're a starting trader, cost means everything. If you're a more experienced trader, professional trader, then cost isn't that important and you're better off going with the more expensive products. As you can see, in terms of cost effective, with Trading station or trading technology, highly cost effective. Sierra charts, highly cost effective with market delta and CQG being a little bit more expensive. Again as noted CQG is the professional industry standard charting package and therefore it is far more expensive. As you can see also investor RT relatively cheap. In terms of functionality, we're talking about what can the product do, how many types of different tools can you use, how functional is the product to be able to use.", "transcript": "Choosing your volume profiling software provider.

In terms of functionality, we're talking about what can the product do, how many types of different tools can you use, how functional is the product to be able to use. Again, as you can see, Trane Technologies does a 4 out of 5, Sierra Charger 3 out of 5, Marker Delta and CQG by far the most functional product options available. This is quite important for predominantly traders that want to go into a more algorithmic, systematic approach, but it's also very important for us as traders when we want to backtest our various strategies. So again, it's highly crucial that you do not go cheap on a product that cannot backtest because you will need this to develop your strategies. So, as you can see, Back testing ability, Trading Technologies gets a 3, Sierra Charts a 3, Market Delta a 4, CQG a 4 and Investor RT a 3. Again we can see the industry leader, both CQG and Market Delta, whilst more expensive, they do have incredibly good back testing abilities. And then our last key characteristic is reliable front-end execution. Whilst this isn't so important for this course, if you are looking to be trading futures using a futures platform, again this is something you might want to consider. What I would say in terms of front-end trading technologies is the industry standard or majority of professional traders do use trading technologies, they have done so for many years and continue to do so. And the reason is simple, the front-end software is extremely reliable, it's extremely good. What we will say is in terms of Sierra Charts, they don't have a known reliable front-end execution software, nor does InvestorRT. Market Delta has a relatively new execution platform, so it's still really much in the testing phases and CQG, whilst they've had their platform for a few more years, they are still very much... an underdog when it comes to front end execution. The most important thing to understand guys is find out what you need, what is important to your trading, what is not going to hold you back and what is not going to cost you money.", "transcript": "industry standard charting package and therefore it is far more expensive.
