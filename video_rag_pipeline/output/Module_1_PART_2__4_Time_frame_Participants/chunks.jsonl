The most important thing to understand about time frame participants is change. What do we mean by change? Change influences market participants of every type, from the day trader to the long term portfolio manager. This movement brings into the marketplace various different timeframe participants. Let's use a basic example. Say now we took out the previous extreme of a previous day. The minute we take out that extreme, we're going to see other timeframe participants reacting or responding to that change. It's that reaction that will dictate the future of price. And as that reaction we need to understand and interpret in order to take advantage of the future movement in price. So let's talk a little bit more about some of these time frame participants that you can expect to see. The first and the shortest term time frame is the scalper. The scalper lives by the minute hand. It continually buys and sells in order to take advantage of discrepancies within the order flow. In essence, the scalper tends to be algorithmic in nature, however you do get human scalpers. They tend to execute large amount of orders, small winners and small losers, and they're exact in the execution. Let's now take a look at a chart whereby we'd be able to see scalpers interacting. As you can see, on the left we have a basic profile. Now note the reason we have the 1 minute chart is because this is the time frame that scalpers tend to react on. Every little bit of movement up and down the page is a scalper, interacting continuously Now, as we can see in the example provided, we spent an entire day within the previous day's range. Most likely there was very little participation from other time frame participants. Most of the participation would have likely been the scalper. Understanding this will allow us to interpret what could occur on the next day.", "transcript": "Now that we've spoken about the various key participants in the market, let's talk a little bit more briefly about the various time frame participants that you can find in the financial markets.
