Now again, this is probably maybe 3 or 4 weeks of data but the concept is the same and that's why I want to show it to you on a little bit of a longer term time frame. So what you can see in the chart is a number of profiles and what's occurred context is we've had a relatively aggressive sell-off and then the market has just started moving sideways in a sideways consolidating holding pattern. So it's bracketing between a low point or support and a high point resistance. Now the point at which the buyers start to buy, they've been brought into that game. The prices have been advertised at such a discount that suddenly buyers are responding to lower prices being advertised. They will keep buying those prices so long as they feel there is a discount at hand. Once they then run into responsive sellers, they will then back off. They will then sort of move out of the market. They will stop responding and buying the market as the responsive sellers start taking premium type prices and so forth and so forth the market continues to sort of ping almost between what we like to think of an initial support zone and an initial resistance zone. The important thing to understand just looking at this chart is how prices, we can see that the price isn't necessarily aggressively moving off support or moving off resistance and there's a very good reason for that. The price being advertised at various points, it's not necessarily always at discount in the sense that there's strong risk-reward to suddenly start fading the trend. Equally, maybe the market pulls back a little bit, but it's not necessarily pulling back enough for us to see aggressive initiative short-side action. And that's why we tend to see a little bit more responsive type price action after seeing very, very aggressive sell-offs or very aggressive rallies. clearly see here is how buyers respond to low prices and the sellers respond to the higher prices. What is interesting to point out, is as you can see in that last profile, eventually we again see the initiation or the initiative price action or the initiative response occurring as we then see a little bit of a continuation of the existing trend. So note, we do move, and that's why this example is good. We don't necessarily always remain in responsive, we see responsive and initiative price action sort of mingling together. the period of the day, sometimes it's responsive and sometimes it's initiative.", "transcript": "Now the example I like to use for sort of more responsive type price action, whilst you do see it on a daily time frame, in order for me to get you to really fully grasp what I'm trying to get across to you, I like to incorporate quite a number of profiles.
