We're now going to talk a little bit more about the volume value area. Remember this is the point where 70% of all the volume transacted on the day is situated around the mean. So what is that? Let's just look a little bit more closely at what the volume value area can show us and then I'm going to show you a few examples and how you can utilize the value So firstly, the volume value area shows where the majority of trade has been facilitated. So it shows us where the majority of the trade was transacted over a series of prices. Now, the open and close of the market relative to the value area is important to note. So, for instance, if the market accepts value at the lower bound of prices over a period of a day, but closes on the high, that's telling us a lot about what occurred or the fight that went on during the day and who won the battle. Then, the value at a width provides clues to how trade is being facilitated, so again, Remember, it's all about the relative metric. So for instance, let's say currently, over a period of 10 days, the value area's range is roughly 10 ticks. All of a sudden on day 11, we see a value area that does 25 ticks, so more than two this tells us something about the market, this tells us something quite exciting about the market, it tells us the potential for you know a pick-up in volatility and remember when there's a pick-up in volatility this equals opportunity. That's why we keep you know this metric with us and that's why we can develop some unique strategies just understanding the current range or the current average range of the value area. Then, the current value area trade location relative to its previous value area, or the previous day's value area, shows a lot about the control of buyers and sellers. We're going to talk a little bit more about this location of the value area as we go through the coming slides. So the question to ask ultimately with today's value area versus yesterday's value area So the basic premise is that the more value area overlap, the more buyers and sellers are agreeing to the same fair value as the previous day. If we have no overlap, it's telling us that buyers and sellers, whilst they transacted at one series of prices yesterday, they're now transacting and accepting fair value at This amount of overlap tells us a lot of information, it tells us a lot about the interaction between buyers and sellers and can give us vital clues about where price and value is", "transcript": "We've spoken quite extensively about volume.
