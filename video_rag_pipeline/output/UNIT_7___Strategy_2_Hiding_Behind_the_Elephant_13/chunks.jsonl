It's almost the case of, you know, the market's relatively passive, it signals or identifies an elephant in the market and turns to relatively aggressive type price action.

Note time is obviously of the essence in terms of the reversal once we do get back above into that elephant zone We do need to see quite a speedy reversal So time is quite crucial in terms of the Delta obviously very very dark shades Around the elephant both to the upside and to the downside in terms of cumulative Delta again No real significant importance why again it is very much a scalper scalp type trade And then obviously in terms of relative change, we do tend to see the most relative shift comes in terms of the price dynamic, all right. Volume and Delta is not highly important in this trade strategy, it's more the color shading to show us the elephant, but then also the shift in price dynamic once we fail to extend upon that elephant.", "transcript": "So in terms of identification, we start off with the interaction.
