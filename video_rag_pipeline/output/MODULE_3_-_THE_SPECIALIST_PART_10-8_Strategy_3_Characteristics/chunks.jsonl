The reason is because an open drive by definition is an initiative play, it's a momentum play Now, just a few things to bear in mind before we actually get into the replay. The context, where do you find this open drive? Where does it likely occur? Well, first and foremost, the open drive exists in every single market. If you look a little bit about the history of the open drive, it's nothing more than where participants, they're fresh out from the night and they've had a lot of time to assess strategies, assess various risks and they've come in with a preconceived plan. They've really thought about what they want to execute, how they want to execute, but most importantly, they want to do it off the gun. They want to, as soon as that market opens, they want to initiate. Whether that's because they fear they may miss out, whether it's for fear that there may be other participants doing the trade. That is irrelevant. What's relevant is that It happens straight away as soon as the markets open. This play does occur, as I said, it occurs both in the bonds. This will typically be, if you're looking at the German bonds or the European bonds, it'll occur either 7am or 8am. If you're looking at the US equities, the S&P or the Dow or the NASDAQ, this will tend to occur around about the cash open. and the euro-dollar FX will tend to occur around about the European cash open. So this play exists in a number of markets and as I showed you the two examples, both the E-Mini S&P and the one you've got in front of you, which is the German Bund, this play is really fantastic. Make sure you spend a lot of time finding this setup and implementing it into your Let's just talk about where you can likely find it. Now some of the places I've always tended to find this is that sometimes when a market opens around key support and resistance. Maybe the day before the markets traded or advertised various prices where bigger, more influential players feel that this is a good area to get involved, whether it's by support and resistance. Then in terms of the same with trend lines, so a lot of the time maybe a market closes the day that looks very aggressive where it almost feels like it's the end game and we're about to see huge trend lines being taken out.", "transcript": "Welcome to the replay series and we're back for strategy three, the open drive, which is the first of the strategies within our momentum strategy series.

Then also when we have really big yield levels in the market, particularly for the bond markets, and also when we have huge risk events out of the way.

When you see an open drive, you need to, if there is a big fundamental, you need to almost ignore that fundamental and just pay attention to the objectivity that the market is showing you, which is that there is very aggressive initiative from the open. Let's get into the setup and see how it plays out over the course of the day. So as I said, we've got the German Bunge as our example, and as you can see the market opened at 7am and straight away from the beginning we've seen quite an aggressive start and the market's opened up. We've seen the market open, the K print nice and aggressive to the upside, and the very next print, note the lack of overlap between the K and the L, so very shallow pullback on the second candle of the day, or the second half hour TPO, and again, note once the cash opens in and around that M print, notice how the market again, very shallow pullback, but also a series of higher lows and higher highs. and then again once the cash market comes in. Now, the first thing to understand, I'm just gonna pause this for a second so we can discuss it. Now, the first play that you wanna be looking for when there is an open drive is firstly, you need to acknowledge the open drive, okay? Now, what I will say with the open drive is that a lot of traders tend to struggle with this play because it tends to come quite early on. It's one of those plays that it doesn't give you about what's happening, it doesn't give you a great amount of time to get involved.

The first play is to identify, so straight away, number one, identify the open drive. And it's likely this will occur within the first hour or two. So within the first one hour or two hours, you will see the open drive. You will see the initiative. So that is why a lot of our traders and most trading floors are very, very switched on and alert as soon as the market opens. Okay, so. The first thing is identify the open drive. Once you've identified the open drive, you need to execute. The first execution on open drive is very simple. The way I would do it is I'm looking for a 38.2% retracement, or any sort of retracement Now the reason I tend to use a 38.2% is because it's very mathematical, it's very relative and therefore I can actually go and work out in terms of risk-reward how often this is going to work relative to what it's going to cost me. So there's different ways to do this. Some traders would enter once, for instance, as you can see in this example, once we leave the set a single print, some traders would enter. Now, in terms of a stop, well, very simply, as you can see, we have the K and the L-print. For me, I would put a stop just in below that L-print. Why? Because if we were to get below that L-print, it's telling me that the early initiative taken is not as strong as I have perceived. So, straight away, guys, these are the two key characteristics of the open drive. One, initiative. How strong is that initiative being taken? The stronger the initiative, the more aggressive the play, and the more likely it is we're going to very aggressively extend with the short-term trend. And two, the second is how deep does the market pull back? What is it telling you about this open drive? What is it telling you about the strength of the buyers? So those are the two key elements you want to pay attention to in the early open drive. Now do bear in mind guys, time is a very important factor in this trade setup. So I'm just going to write down your time now. What time means for us in this open drive is that, let's say for instance this market, the K and L prints come in. and then maybe the Q, so suddenly the market started forming a whole number of prints at the high of the day. Now it's not to say that this play has failed, it's not to say the trade opportunity no", "transcript": "That very aggressive start to the day tends to make traders panic a little bit, it tends to make them lose a little bit of focus and sight as to what's actually happening.

Now it's not to say that this play has failed, it's not to say the trade opportunity no longer exists, but the longer it takes for the initiative to continue, the weaker the initiative is. Let me repeat that. So the longer or the more time it takes for the market to show the initiative or the weaker the initiative is. And that weakness is not necessary that buyers are strong, it just means that buyer's initiative is being met with responsive sell-side action. Remember, if there are sellers selling, and we wanting prices to go higher, they won't go high. They'll only go high so long as the sellers are not responding to higher prices. So that is how we use time in this trade setup. Now, Let's play this through and I'm going to go through some of the characteristics and the execution style with you. So note we were looking for entry point in and around that 160 area, just above that 160 area. So as you can see here, the market, the cash opened, very quickly took up the initial balance high and we can see now the market is starting to spend a little bit of time distributing above the initial balance. So again, note what we said here, we got four TPO's, so almost two hours of trade that was distributing, telling us that maybe the initiative was not as strong as expected. and actually gave us a relatively nice pullback opportunity. Now again, remember, when you have an open drive, you're looking to constantly initiate in the direction of the short-term trend. So the minute you see an open drive, you need to write somewhere on your trade paper, somewhere down there, you need to write, I do not want to be going counter-trend today, okay? When you see an open drive, that is a day type. You do not want to fade. You only want to be looking for momentum-type plays. Okay, so first straight away we can identify the market's got a whole bunch of single prints there, again we saw the Q print try and come in and fill those single prints and fail. Now remember we said single prints indicate to us initiative, they indicate to us almost failure to hole or to manage to fill in the anomaly. Now as we can see the market's trying to come in again on the T print, trying to So what we're looking for now is whether or not, if these single prints get filled, whether or not or how low the market wants to move.

Now what we're looking for again is any buy side opportunity so long as the open drive tail holds. the key point within an open drive is the opening price. We should not be taking out the opening price. If we take out the opening price remember we have an opportunity to the downside as a flood of stops are likely to be triggered. Again, also don't forget, the more we eat into this tail, the more prices drift down into this open tail, the less initiative or the less amount of strength that is being shown about the buy. So what we can see here is notice how not only is the market holding onto its tail, but it's also now holding onto the single prints and more importantly forming a higher distribution. So what you can see is that if we're sitting in and around buying the Q prints, buying the U prints, buying the T prints, buying the X prints, now potentially also buying in around these Y prints, notice how the market is not punishing you for being long. In essence, it's actually rewarding you every single time for going long, it's rewarding And that's the clue, that's why we watch back this strategy because you can very clearly see if you were a buyer on this day type, it's been a relatively easy day for you. It doesn't matter, you might have even executed badly, might have executed somewhere around this area, but how much risk have you taken executing at that area versus how much potential you could have made executing at that area. But the principle first and foremost is the most important thing because if we get the principle right, we can then afford to spend time developing or getting better at execution. So note again, note how the Y print, the single prints have now filled, but note how quickly the market again rejected and navigated away from that area, protecting the buying tail and the open drive. And then again, note the extension of the B print. So that's pretty much our open drive, guys. It's a very, very simple, but highly effective trade strategy. It's effective because, one, we get the early initiative. Now, all I want to finish off by talking about is, in terms of the management of this trade, this is a key, key thing to talk about. panic with the management.

They've missed out on the only potential opportunity of the day. And all of a sudden, instead of noticing and objectively looking at the market, they suddenly say to themselves, well, this has gone too fast, let me start selling. And then all of a sudden the market goes higher, and what do they do? and they're still selling and the problem is that the market is it's not punishing shorts aggressively but it's not paying shorts easily. So a trader can manage to sit shorting the whole day without objectively looking at the market which is telling them actually the easy money is to be a buyer today, not to be a seller. So that's the important thing with regards to this trade, is do not panic. If you manage this trade, do not panic into the trade. Why? Because notice the M print, the cash opens, it gives you a chance. Notice the Q print, it gives you a chance. The U print, the Y print, the Z print, the market has given you five individual opportunities in this one market throughout the period of the day. You didn't have to sell this market once today to be successful. That is the key to the setup. That is the key to the open drive. Don't forget the open drive exists in any market. That can be not just futures markets. You can find the open drive in equities markets because the basic understanding is that initiative is taken early on. That concludes then our strategy three, the open drive. My personal favorite strategy, spend some time developing and finding the strategy, not just in the bonds, not just in the equities, but look for it in the currencies, look for it in the oil and the gold.
