It does require a lot of early observation, it does require contextual understanding of what a bias implies, but ultimately once you've grasped this and you've got your line in the sand, it's simply just focusing on when we get back to that red line and if we do, we simply execute. We spoke a lot about bias and we spoke about fundamental and technical biases, so do make sure you actually write down what created that bias. In terms of bias, we do observe obviously the delta and the cumulative delta as well as the price response. Trending markets do tend to create a better technical bias, therefore, you're probably going to see an easier delta unwind when there's a technical drive driven as a result of a trending market. In terms of balance imbalance, again, ideally imbalanced as it manifests strong technical biases. Okay, so an imbalanced market, obviously, it's going to suck in a lot more participants into extremes, therefore creating a much stronger bias and position in the market. Breakout or trending we mentioned we said you can also find in low volume errors as well as initiative Drive so these were all the sort of focus points where potentially you could see a delta unwind, but again It's not an exhaustive list, it's about you identifying, you know, where did this delta unwind occur? Okay, because over time, you're going to have a set of maybe three or four different lines in the sand that you find work very well. And most importantly, guys, you know, the real crux, and hopefully I've driven this home over the last couple of units, is that you don't have to take all ten of these strategies. If you take one and adopt it, and you execute it and you become very successful, then that's my job done. But what's most important, just like with a strategy, is you don't have to have multiple lines in the sand. You might only want to trade the strategy when it gets to one line in the sand or when there's only one bias in the market, like a fundamental bias. So I've just given you a number of variations. It's up to you to go and explore these variations through the numerous completions of these templates and adopt what makes the most sense to you. to create the initial leg for obvious reasons, to create that bias. They need to get everyone into the same position. But then the reversal is created by the speculative now. So we mentioned the reason why the initiative players, the big players, they don't tend to use such tight stops. So the reversal tends to come as a result of the unwind of the shorter time frame positions. In terms of liquidity, high liquidity on the bias phase creates higher cumulative delta.

In terms of liquidity, high liquidity on the bias phase creates higher cumulative delta. Note this cements the positional bias so low liquidity on stop down provides a sharp position unwind lower. In terms of volatility it'll be high on the stop run with a low level So interaction is quite important the most important interaction you want to pay attention to is in and around that line in the sand. So that point where the volatility steps up. I think if you really want to get good at the strategy just always observe the moment that big unwind comes. Go and view what was the key interaction taking place at that point and you'll very quickly learn some identifiers. Now in terms of interaction obviously we will see initiative in the bias accumulation. Why obviously because that's going to suck in a lot of participants and it'll leave low volume areas and imbalances In terms of obviously interaction it will be aggressive on the initial drive where it sucks in the bias But equally once it's formed the consolidation phase ahead of the line in the sand Once it does begin to unwind again. It will look quite aggressive Okay note the line in the sands include and I gave a couple of examples and again just a list you can always add to this list subtract and you know do whatever works best for you and adds value to your trading so obviously previous days high and low sets of single prints imbalances and low volume areas delta pocket positions starting price of data piece as well as the 50 of the daily range okay and that tends to work the 50 does work In terms of the metrics we're going to pay attention to obviously volume, dark blue volume on the trend leg and then unwind again you're going to see some potentially dark volume when finally the responsive behaviour steps in. But again note the variations in the volume, where does it come in, where does it not. In terms of time, obviously short or measured time at the line of the sand. So this is something we spoke about. Sometimes the line of the sand provides a bit of a consolidatory phase before it obviously unwinds the delta. Sometimes it happens very quickly. So again, make sure that you're noting this down, noting down time as a key component. In terms of the delta then, it should accumulate consistently, reflecting this bias.

So again, note those relative changes. I've been through this enough times with you guys. Look at that summary box, look at the color shift changes, look at the interaction, the volume etc etc. Okay, let's turn our attention then to the execution of the the unwind of the Delta. So obviously in terms of execution, We need to be both passive and aggressive in terms of execution. We can be preemptive, but again, only if we do get that little bit of a signal, which will come in the form of a bit of a consolidatory pattern. If you do get that signal, you can be in early and then add on the brake. If not, we just add on the brake ahead of the wash down. In terms of wrist stop, we're always above the rotational zone, so where that little consolidation zone comes in ahead of the line of the sand, that's kind of where we want to stop. But again, manage this, play with this, always find ways to reduce your stop and ultimately increase your targets. That being said, the target will be a retest of the extreme, an extension of the extreme, a stop down that creates an exhaust of high or low. So whichever one of these three comes first, that will be your signal to take some profits. Bear in mind as this is a stop down, once it does bounce and find response in the opposite direction, you could see quite an aggressive bounce. Okay, so do be warned, don't leave profits on the table. In terms of risk reward, very, very high. We've got a marginal stop and we've got a target of bigger than 50% of the current range. So really good risk-reward metrics. Note in terms of the application, like I said, you can be preemptive and then add on the break. That means we can get quite leveraged on this simply because we can add early. If we add early, it means we can add onto the break, which gives us a lovely leveraged position to take advantage of the market's impending move.

Let's move on then to our next of our additional reading. I am most traders that know me on the floor Or that have been around me on a floor before I would know that I used to have a little bit of an emotional streak I used to verbalize emotion. I used to sometimes show emotion. I used to moan a lot Generally, I was a nice guy, but I had this emotion. I was giving energy to this emotion And eventually I decided I had to do something to stop and I had to do something you know to eradicate this bad habit and I mean I tried probably about a year and a half, two years ago to try and you know get rid of it, tame it, understand it etc etc and it was this book that ultimately got me to get rid of it. Okay it's from Dale Carnegie, again it's one of those self-help books. It's probably, you pick it up, it's a small book, you're probably going to read and think this was a silly book. Why did I read this? But what's beautiful about it is that it's so silly in It probably has all the clichés you've ever heard of, but that you've never adopted, and that's what makes it so highly effective, is that it keeps things simple, it brings out some really, really important, really strong, effective life lessons, and it does provoke your thoughts and ultimately humble you. So that is the action, you're going to have your thoughts provoked, and you're going to hopefully become far more humbled by this book. It's titled How to Enjoy Your Life. And job, again, probably a title that scares you away, but just humor me. Now in terms of key highlights, it's a simple way to become more grateful. And that's what I was missing. That was the key element I was missing. I've always been a grateful person, but I've never spent enough time really thinking about the things that are important in life. One of the biggest problems that traders have in pitfalls is that we can become self-absorbed. There's no secret. Everything we do is for ourselves. We're not very good team players.
