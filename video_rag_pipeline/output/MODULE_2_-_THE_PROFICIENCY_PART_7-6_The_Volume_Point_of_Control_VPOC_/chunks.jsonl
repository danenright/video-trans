We briefly spoke about this in module 1, I showed you how to identify this in the volume profile but now we're going to take a look at why the volume profile is important to be able to understand and interpret and what it can mean over a period of a trading session. As it's better known and as people will often You know name it is the price at which the most volume in a trading session can be found So that price over a period of a day where the most volume is transacted is known as the volume point of control In basic sense it is the price that has received the most trading activity within a trading session Now note markets that are in balance tend to retest this point of control whilst they remain in balance So straight away bang the market opens and you've identified opening in balance There is a very high probability that we will retest the previous day's volume point of control Again, knowing this little bit of information can aid you in developing a very early strategy just based on where the market is opening in terms of trade location. Now, the point of control can also act as a strong reference point in markets that are slowly accepting value higher or lower. So what we mean by that is that when we see a trending day or when we see initiative taken in the market, what we tend to see is a developing volume point of control. But then as price rises, we see the volume point of control continues to rise over the entire session. Now, traditionally as a rule of thumb, in a trend day, the volume point of control will constantly be moving with the trend, and more often than not will literally be closing. The volume point of control will be at either the high of the day in an uptrend Then the more pronounced the V Park the more significant it becomes so a lot of the time we could see in a volume profile Maybe five or six or seven different prices could have been the volume point of control and the volume difference between those prices is very Marginal in that case. It's slightly less pronounced However, if you know we have a very pronounced volume point of control where that price is the obvious you know price that traded the most volume, well that makes it more pronounced and more likely to be retested. Then, we can observe the volume point of control in two ways. One is the static point of control from the previous section, and the second is the new point of control being formed on the current day.
