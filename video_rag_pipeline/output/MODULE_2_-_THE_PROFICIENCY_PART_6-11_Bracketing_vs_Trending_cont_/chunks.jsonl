Now, the reason I want to almost annotate this for you is to just show you how the markets don't simply stop and then go sideways and then trend again. There's very important key identifiers that will move us from bracketing into trending and vice versa. So very basically, what do we mean by bracketing? We see a little bit of initiative, we then run into a little bit of responsive selling. The market then starts to rotate over. Those buyers then get out of those long positions and sell. That takes the market lower until we run into again responsive buyers and we continue and continue and continue. Markets can bracket or move sideways for a lot longer than you think. In actual fact, markets tend to move sideways for very very long periods of time. Now one of the key things that will you know can obviously shift us from you know a bracketing to a trending market is a shift in fundamentals. Now what you have to ask yourself is how often do we get you know very big fundamental shifts? Now what I would say to you is, in my career, in the early years, we had the European crisis and we had all the central banks cutting interest rates and there was a lot of panic around would Europe continue to exist. So back in those years of 2010, 2011, 2012, there was a high tendency for a lot of trend in the markets with very brief periods of bracketing. 2013, 2014, 2015, stopped. We saw most markets move into bracketing type price action. Now, fundamentals is one of the key factors that can obviously shift us from bracketing to trending. Now what do we mean by that? Well, if for instance we take an example, we look at the Euro-dollar index and we can see that since late 2014 we've had this really strong rally in the Euro-dollar index Then, all of a sudden, since the Donald Trump victory, we've started to see that trend continue. The second type of main reason or cause that we get a market moving from bracketing to trending would be very key technical breaks. What do I mean by key technical breaks? This is important to understand. I don't mean daily market moves. I don't mean little bits of volatility in the markets or pockets of noise.", "transcript": "All right guys, let's take a look at a basic example of what we mean by bracketing versus trending markets.

Almost like the market saying we've moved away from where we thought fair value was and we feel now that the trend needs to continue. So that's what we mean by a key technical break, it's the point where the technical timeframe players into the market. That's the two key reasons or ways in which we move from bracketing to a trending market. Let's just illustrate now and finish off just in terms of how it would work and what causes us to move from bracketing to trending. So as you can see in this initial example, the market is bracketing. Now let's say we get a key piece of fundamental news in this market that drives us outside of the bracket. Now the first point you have to pause, first point you have to look at as a trader occurs in that area. That's one of the most important things to interpret because you need to understand is it an initiative taking it through there? Is it merely the buyers that are long, that are liquidating that's taking it lower or is it fresh new business coming into the market that's taking it lower? Understanding and interpreting that basic principle will then allow you to interpret whether or not we continue in that direction, whether we continue aggressively in that direction, or whether we turn back around and aggressively reverse. So the important thing to understand is what we should see, the expectation is that we should see some initiative selling at this area, in other words new business. So straight away you've got to cotton on or look at how the market responds in this area. Does it look like initiative or does it just look like sellers that are half-heartedly committing to lower prices, in which case maybe we get the grind type phase or equally we just get a stop run and the market turns back around and continues to bracket. Now remember what I said guys, when a market does bracket and trend, if we do then reverse up higher, it's highly likely we find new ground to the upside and then continue to", "transcript": "The second type of main reason or cause that we get a market moving from bracketing to trending would be very key technical breaks.
