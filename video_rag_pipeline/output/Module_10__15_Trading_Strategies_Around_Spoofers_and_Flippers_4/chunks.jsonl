The moment it hits that liquidity zone there's two-way flow. You go on the opposite side of that large order and you wait for that large order to be pulled and then you exit your trade and that's effectively a of how to deploy a trading strategy around a loan arranger. Just remember the flipper can control the market and fill the book. When liquidity conditions are low and paper activity is low. So it generally occurs Intra-range generally during the quiet periods of the lunchtime periods when the market isn't in new expansive territory There are no new market participants. There's no key economic data point. There's no key geopolitical risk That's moving the markets aggressively. So it normally occurs in quiet conditions when someone can effectively with enough size bully the order book Just remember it is liquidity hunting and gathering with price optimization. So what I mean by that, you know It's it's seeking liquidity and what you're trying to do is it's trying to optimize the price those really strategic High frequency systems or those brokers that are looking to fill their clients with the with the best price They really employ these types of HDH FT systems or execution systems Where they because remember it's it's an industry if you can get your client a better fill, your client is phoning you, whether it's a big hedge funds phoning, multiple brokers saying, well what price can you give me? Those with the most sophisticated execution systems that optimize price will get the business. So therefore those that can really find those liquidity zones and bully the market effectively to its optimum price will get the business. And that's really why those types of loan ranges exist.

I'm just describing a few setups but you'll see there are so many different algorithms and through the exercise drills that we give you right at the end, you'll start picking up your own algorithmic setups and how you can trade around them and how you can trade within them. They sometimes occur in the Euro stocks one week, in the Bund another week, in the DAX, the S&P 500, the oil market. and how the different personalities of these algo's and then how do you profit from these execution algo's where they work these little ranges, you start observing these subtle little patterns and how do you deploy the right strategy because sometimes these algo's can exist in the marketplace for a month, for two months. Some of our traders during 2011 and 12 when there were some algo's that would exist for two months, we'd be able to, between six to seven p.m. in the evening, algorithms every night for half an hour and profit from them because they observe a key execution pattern and they just trade within that algorithm. So it's very important, your observation points and your consistent debriefing at the end of the day, you're able to spot this whole universe of patterns and it's just your ability then to execute the right trades.", "transcript": "well what price can you give me?
