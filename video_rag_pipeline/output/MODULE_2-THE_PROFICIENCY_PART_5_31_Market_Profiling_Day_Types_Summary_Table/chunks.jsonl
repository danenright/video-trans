Make a copy of this, print it off, keep it close to your desk, learn these day types off by heart because if you can identify a day type very very early on, it's going So, what are the five day types? Remember we had non-trend days which included normal days, neutral days with a central or a relatively normal close, we then had the neutral day with an extreme close, we then have the normal variation of a normal day and then the two trend days being traditional and double distribution. As you can see, they are the various characteristics you will find within each Now, the important thing, and what I've tried to show you here, is what a basic example of the initial balance, or what the overnight session ranges might look like. Again, this is just a very simple example so that I can try and help you to understand what the initial trade would look like because of the level of conviction. As you can see, in a non-trend normal day, we have a very wide range and we tend to remain within that range. In a neutral day, we have not necessarily small but a relatively small initial range and the market extends on both sides. In a neutral day extreme close, remember we close on one of the extremes, giving us an early bias for the next day. A normal variation of a normal day, again we have a relatively small initial range but we get the extension on one side or the other once that initiative comes from either the buyers or the sellers. And then with a trend day and a double distribution day we tend to have average type ranges in the initial trade of the day or the initial balance. As you can see then, those are some of the examples of graphic depictions of what the day types might look like. As you can see with the bars on the left, those represent the initial trade and then how the profile might look over the period of the day. Take a picture of this, photocopy this, you're going to get tested on this in not just the concept checker, but I'm going to ensure that you understand these five or six day types and can apply them across many different examples. This is one of the more important sort of sections we're going to deal with in module 2.
