TT algos are synthetic order types that provide functionality beyond what is natively supported by many exchanges. With TT algos, you can trigger orders when certain conditions are met and reduce the impact of your orders on the market. You can trigger orders on price action, slice orders into smaller increments, submit or cancel orders based on the fills of other orders, and more. TT algos are accessible from the order ticket using the order type drop-down, as well as from MDTrader through the order pane. At the top of the order type list, we see our standard order types supported by the exchange for the selected instrument. Beneath, we have our TT algos. We'd like to place an order to buy 200 euro stocks futures on Eurex, but we don't want to disclose our entire order. Eurex does not natively support an iceberg order type, but with TT algos we can select the TT iceberg. Clicking our desired algo displays a flyout menu where we can enter our parameters. For our TT iceberg order, let's submit our order in increments of 25 at a time by setting the display to 25. When finished, we close our flyout menu. If we want to change our settings, we simply click Edit. With our algo selected, we can place our TT iceberg order by clicking on the desired price level in MDTrader. We see in our order book that TT algos consist of parent The parent order is the synthetic order that resides on the Elgo server and can submit either single or multiple child orders. Child orders are the native orders that are actually placed on the exchange. In our parent order, we see our order type of TT Iceberg, our order quantity of 200, our working quantity of 25, and our undisclosed quantity of 175. We can see our child order is a 25-lot limit order. The parent order will submit another child order of 25 into the market and so on until the total order quantity of 200 is filled. For TT algos that we use frequently, we can create custom order type buttons in MDTrader. We right-click in our MDTrader to access the Settings menu and can then select Order Type buttons. We click the green Add icon and open the drop-down menu to view the list of order types and TT algos. Let's select our TT iceberg algo. we can see a preview of the button to the right. When finished, we click OK. We would like this button to appear on all future MDTrader widgets, so we are going to select Set as Global Defaults. To make our button available, we click Apply and then Save. As you can see, we now have our TT Iceberg button in our MDTrader order pane. When we click this button, we are provided the TT Iceberg algo order parameters. Let's again set our display to 25. Our custom order button is highlighted yellow indicating that this algo order type is active and ready to be placed in the market.
