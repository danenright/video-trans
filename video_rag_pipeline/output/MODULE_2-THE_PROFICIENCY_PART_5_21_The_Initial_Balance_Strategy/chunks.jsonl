So the first time we would look to use the initial balance is when there's key structure or identifiable structure in the market. So what would this structure look like? Let's look at a basic example. Let's say over the last two sessions, the market had become somewhat contained and we had started trading in a bracket type trade formation and the market formed an inside day. What you can see is very clear structure in the market where the market is consolidating and waiting for a move or response. Now typically on this day we want to pay attention in the initial balance open or in the period, in the first hour of trade, looking for a potential extension either to the downside or to the upside. Now note, the key with this strategy is not to preempt. We don't want to preempt that it's going to break in the initial balance. What we want to do is wait for the flow, wait for the market to give us the information and then look to execute buy orders on the break to the upside and sell orders to the break to the downside. Now a few things to pay attention to when looking at the setup. It's very simple. going into it. What do I mean by that? In essence, if the market is aggressively selling off before this consolidation day time, there's a much higher probability that we're going to get an easier extension once we break the inside day toward the downside. Why? Because the short-term trend is in that direction. So that is what we mean by context. Now, important to note as well is that what you want to pay attention to is also the failed extension of the initial balance breakout. So if we cannot hold that break, if we cannot hold above the previous day's high or low on the break, we could very likely then see a very strong reversal in the opposite direction. So that's the first type of trade strategy we would look at when using the initial A second very key trading strategy would be looking for tails in the initial period. So what do we mean by tails? Let's refresh your mind. Now a tail is nothing more than when a market leaves a relatively untraded area of prices. So what you have here is what I would call the first 30 minute TPO's of the day. We very aggressively drove higher we then had the L print come in and the L prints failed to actually Get into lower prices now what we would typically call this is our tail", "transcript": "Now that we've spent a little bit of time discussing what the initial balance is, let's take a look at three unique trading strategies you could execute using the initial balance.

We very aggressively drove higher we then had the L print come in and the L prints failed to actually Get into lower prices now what we would typically call this is our tail All right our buying tail now what we're looking to lean on the initial balance Yeah for is a a cash open or the next TPO open to look to continue and extend in the direction Remember guys a tail initiative, and that is what we pay attention to. So that's the second kind of key strategy we'd be looking for in using the initial balance. The third and final strategy we would be looking at would be a failed weekly extension. So what do we mean by that? Well as traders we don't just look at daily profiles, we actually also look at weekly profiles. the value area low or the volume value area low and the volume value area high. These are relatively key metrics in the market. Now what we want to look to do is if the market comes early on a Monday morning and within the previous area of trade from the previous week and the market tries to extend very early on on the previous week's lowest traded price, we want to be very, very cautious going with that within the initial balance. What we do tend to find is the high probability that markets tend to initially fail to extend highs and lows that we point out. So that would be our third point of using an initial balance. We want to see how the initial balance responds on a previous week's low or previous week's high and look for the potential failure and reversal into the opposite direction. So those are three unique trading strategies we would develop using the initial balance. Now the purpose of me showing you these patterns on the board is not to show you the only patterns that can be utilized with the initial balance. The key is to show you that there are very specific strategies that we would employ when using the initial balance. Now it's up to you first and foremost to understand what exactly is the initial Then once you understand that, to begin to identify what are the key patterns that you can develop using the initial balance. Good luck and we'll see you again in the next part.", "transcript": "So what you have here is what I would call the first 30 minute TPO's of the day.
