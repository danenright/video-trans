So for example, in the two charts provided, both are EURDFX charts, what you can see This happens to be the day four of the euro dollar FX consolidation pattern I was showing you previous slides Now the important thing to note in this in this chart is how at the end of the day if you looked at this chart There's two very very key anomalies that are sticking out like a sore thumb The first is the low volume area of the early consolidation in the first chart What you can see is the market spent quite a bit of time early in the morning consolidating before breaking out of the previous day's range. Once we broke out of the previous day's range the market very quickly auctioned away from the break point and continued to move higher. Then later on in the day you can see an excess tail or a premium tail where sellers These two patterns alone are extremely identifiable on any chart and across many many different days. That is why we use volume profiling, so we can pick up on these patterns quite quickly and easily. In the next slide and the following slides, we are going to be developing a lot more strategies based on these anomalies and other strategies using the volume profile.", "transcript": "Now that we've completed the three steps required when using volume profiling, we're going to finish off with just showing you how you would now start to begin to develop various trade strategies with the volume profile.
