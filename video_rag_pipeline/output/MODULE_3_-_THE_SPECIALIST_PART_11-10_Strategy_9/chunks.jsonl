That is the engulfing profile and engulfing value area. Now before we get into the specifics of this trade strategy, let's just discuss a few of the key characteristics behind why trending strategies not just work so well, but why Now, the first thing is to understand is that when the markets are trending, we are merely out of balance. So by definition, when a market is out of balance, it's forcing various different time frame participants to respond to the change in prices. This change in prices is what presents the unique opportunities for us. One of the key things to understand is when markets are trending they tend to catch a lot of people off guard and they tend to test a varying amount of skills in other words Now, if you are used to day-to-day trading where the markets distribute and don't move too aggressively or in a volatile manner, you have a tendency to develop various types of skills. So, when a trending day comes along, this happens to test skills that we are maybe not used to utilizing day in and day out. And that is why trending days, whilst they are wonderful, they do tend to reward those that are best prepared and that have got the best skills. it. Now, one of the things to understand is that a day, the trending day or the day after a trending day, it does present unique opportunities as you've seen in the day to trend and as I'm about to show you in the engulfing profile value. However, it only rewards those that have got a firm action plan and that are prepared to execute based on the way or based on the manner in which the market is likely to present itself. Now, one of the key things to understand when we talk about the money management of trend days is that you need to accept that with wider rewards or wider probability or possibility of making money, you need to have a wider probability of also losing money, so make sure when you do go over your various execution styles, make sure that you interpret slightly wider profit targets as well as wider stops. With that in mind, let's get into this trade strategy and discuss all the various opportunities. Now first thing to understand is what an engulfing profile is or an engulfing value area.

And this is a mistake I see a lot of traders making. They tend to assume because we've had an engulfing day type that the next day ought to have some form of trend. What I would say is this is factually not correct. Now knowing this puts you in a particularly powerful position.

With that in mind, let's just quickly discuss what an engulfing value area is. Very simply put, if this is the previous day's range with the lines depicting the previous day's value area, on day two the market again overlaps quite a lot of overlap Again, by definition, this engulfing does not imply trend, but merely volatility and potential for larger rotations. Now, the key strategies when developing the engulfing setup are as follows. Firstly, we have the retest. we have an engulfing day type, the next day the probability of retesting the low is quite high. So again, we can see if we have an engulfing towards the downside, the probability of retesting this low is relatively high. However, in terms of execution, we do want to ensure that we are executing at a good trade location. The second strategy would be looking for some form of a continuation.

The second strategy would be looking for some form of a continuation. So again in the example we'd look for the open and a breakdown of the previous day's extreme and the potential for continuation. Now in this example what's key to understanding with regards to the continuation is what happens at the extreme. One of the best ways to determine whether or not there's a probability for extension or not is to determine whether or not we get initiative on the break or not. If there is flow, momentum, volatility, and some strong control identifies on the break of the previous day's extreme in the direction of the engulfing candle, this is very suggestive that we could get a relatively aggressive continuation type move. However, again, if we fail to extend the previous day's low and cannot sustain the break, we could likely see a relatively aggressive move in the opposite direction as we expect to see an unwind of the short-term positioning. Now, one of the key things in terms of going forward in terms of the execution is how we execute and I'm going to show that to you in the slides ahead. What is important to understand is what actually creates the engulf because this will give us a good idea as to the potential for opportunity. So an engulf can be created by a number of factors. Now, as you can see in the example provided, the market was clearly relatively long on the day. We then had quite an aggressive up move. The market returned back to the original area where the initiative took place and then completely unwound all the long positioning. This is the first reason for an engulfing candle. The second reason is for an aggressive positioning on a shift or change in the This simply means that if, for instance, the market's trading, we happen to get a key piece of data or something that creates the volatility for a shift in prices, longer-term institutions step in and take advantage of the sudden shift in prices, but not only do they return prices to where they began, but they continue to initiate. Let's now take a look at the example and open up this profile and see how this date Now, key to understand that is when we have these engulfing day twos, you need to be relatively passive on your execution.

For all intents and purposes, this market could have continued quite aggressively to the downside.

Now the key to understanding this is that if we are going to trade this day type and the strategy, we need to be willing to be more passive on entry once we break below the previous day's range.
