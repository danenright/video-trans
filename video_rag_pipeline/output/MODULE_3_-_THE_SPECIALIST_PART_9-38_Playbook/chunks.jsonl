I hope you've enjoyed part 9 and are actually starting to get a little bit excited now that we've finally begun to develop unique trading strategies. Most important, don't forget, it's all good and well me spending time helping you develop these trade strategies and showing you them and learning to interpret them, but you need to go and apply them practically. What you're going to find throughout part 9, 10, 11 and 12 is a very, very hands-on practical approach to developing your playbook. In essence, I'm going to get you to take every one of the 11 trade strategies that I've developed with you throughout Module 3 and I'm going to get you to find them in the markets and implement them into your very own playbook. So answer the following. Find strategy 1 and 2 that we developed in part 9, the low-volume area and the double distribution, and I want you to go and find them in the following markets and complete the template that I provided for you in the playbook. So find them in the E-Money S&P 500, the German Bund Tenure, the WTI Nimex Oil and the EURUSD FX. Take some time finding these strategies. Interpret each one individually. Make sure you're looking at the specific characteristics behind each one. Good luck and we'll see you again in part 10.", "transcript": "Welcome to the end of part 9, the playbook.
