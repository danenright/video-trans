This is strategy 10 unit 15 Which is all about risk events and you know, I did show you two really cool risk events. One was obviously the Trump-Flynn Saga and that was you know, and then obviously the euro CPI and I think the just of these risk events and the real key Takeaway that hopefully you all picked up on is that it's all about preparation. Okay, every single thing comes down to preparation. You need to prepare the context of your market. You need to have a good understanding of where your market is trading going into that risk event. If I was to summarize what a risk event is, in essence it forces participants to respond would have. Why? Because the data or the announcement or whatever it might be pushes prices to a point where a lot more participants have to respond. That's what you have to recognize. These risk events bring opportunities simply because they force the strategies to come a lot quicker than they would have otherwise without the data. What are we going to look at? It is the UK inflation data in December. It was expected to come out at 3% and it actually came out 0.1% lower than expected. Now it was important simply because of where the Bank of England's stance was. That obviously just recently hiked and the market was trying to figure out when that next potential rate hike could come. The important thing is we're going to play this through, and all I want to just reference, the reason why the footprint is so fantastic for risk event trading, is simply because the less participants in the market and the less liquidity, the easier it is to ultimately see and pick up when that first bit of absorption actually comes into the market. Again, what we're going to see, we're going to talk us through, we're going to ultimately see that fast money move down. Again, very unlikely that you're ever going to be able to partake in this simply because It would need to be a real outlier. So we said in order to be aggressive in order to get those trend trend type moves You would require a real a strong piece of you know, outlier information So in this example, I would say anything 0.2 or 0.3 of a miss would have been an outlier Obviously it only came out as a 0.1 outlier Okay So again bang we hear the number the number comes up 0.1 and we see the initial reaction very quick opportunity to get involved there. We did obviously, however, recognize that the first pullback is always quite crucial. So what we're looking at on this footprint on the right side is we're looking for that first bit of absorption. So we're looking for absorption and seller to absorb as well as seller at the same time.

Not a great deal traded there. The top was 04s. Now, again, remember, obviously, liquidity is still very much at a premium. That's why the markets are so thin. So to safeguard ourselves, we do want to see a little more absorption, and there we can see it. Notice straight away what's coming in, 111. What are we seeing? Absorbing on the offer, but equally selling at the best bid. So there's our absorption taking place. We now enter our trade. We want to enter at the 00s, at the 01s, where that absorption took place, looking note a little bit of absorption there 58 contracts trade again side by side where that absorption was okay so really good example of how you can see nothing going on and suddenly the footprint can really highlight where that absorption comes in on the first pullback okay The market then obviously starts to offer, and this is quite crucial, when the market has identified that volume pocket or that absorption, it will tend to offer very quickly down again, simply because of how thin the market is. We can see it on the candlestick as well. Do note, obviously still relatively okay volume on that rotation, good delta in relative terms. But again, this is where assessing the data is crucial. Had this number been a 0.2 miss, we would have had a much higher probability of extending lower than if it was just a 0.1 miss as we got. Okay, so the market then obviously forms a little inside candle. We do get a little extension, a little test of the previous low, market double bottoms and straight away we begin to auction back higher. Okay, the market then goes, and I mean most of you have been through this example now, it does come back up, it retests that point of absorption that we identified, and then offers back down again. I don't really want to go over too much more in this video simply because we've identified what the real key element to risk event trading is. It's about, number one, making sure you know what the outliers are versus what's expected. You create the binary. That's the real key to getting good at this strategy. You create the binary in your head. It either does A and you execute A or it does B and you execute B.
