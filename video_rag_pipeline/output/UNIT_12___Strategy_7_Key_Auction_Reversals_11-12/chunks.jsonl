That being said, let's follow the process, let's complete the template together. In the initiative to initiative by the very nature is trending to trending. We do see obviously the fall the small phases of absorption You know from the obviously response as well as the secondary response. I did go through that in quite a great detail So as you completing this again go run through that run through that process of interaction That you see when seeing this trade strategy In terms of balanced-imbalanced, you're going to see this in balanced markets. Why? Well, simply imbalanced. Market auction theories suggest that key auction reversals occur when price is at a discount or at a premium. In terms of trade location at the extremes, note obviously with the name for this is the V or inverse V and the two variations were ultimately the symmetrical V or inverse as well as the engulfing or outside candles at the extremes, those are the two variations we discussed. So again. Highlight this in terms of where we trading where does it occur and ultimately you can draw upon that information down the line in terms of conditioning of the markets note initiative requires large time frame participants so we're going to be seeing a lot of them because of that liquidity you know will be relatively low as we initiate in one direction and then again low as we initiate in the opposite direction so just keep that in mind obviously you know as we do see this initiation liquidity does tend to be at a premium hence why we tend to move the way we do bear in mind as I the degree of how far a market will move is all based on how much liquidity is being provided to those participants. More liquidity, smaller move. Less liquidity, much further move. Okay, in terms of volatility, it won't be excessive. This is the interesting thing. Most people tend And it's simply because it's unusual for markets to do these sorts of, you know, V-reversals, okay? It's very unusual for a market to go straight line up and then straight line down, okay?", "transcript": "Enjoy that strategy session and the examples and hopefully you're excited now you know I think at the end of every one of these strategy sessions you should really be getting revved up to just go and apply yourself into the market now again what I would say put the brakes on don't develop bad habits early on you know make sure you're completing Follow the process, you know, my old boss in my first ever job used to have a wonderful expression of there is always method in the madness of a process and sometimes we think processes are silly and we don't understand the point of them, but in time as we grow, I'd like to use the word wiser, we do tend to recognize how important these processes are and why we follow them.

It's very unusual for a market to go straight line up and then straight line down, okay? I have that expression that I've shared with you earlier on the course. It takes time for a ship to turn. but every now and again that ship turns pretty quickly and when it does you have to make sure you've got a rules-based approach or a strategy approach to executing and if not executing make sure you're avoiding you know losing too much when there is fact-based information So, the interaction was probably the key to understanding this entire strategy. If you want to get good at the strategy, you're going to have to be almost like a professional interaction specialist. Just like footballers, you get professional guys who take the free kicks all the time. It's a similar thing. If you really want to be good at the strategy, you're going to have to learn to recognize when we have that very aggressive switch in price action from initiative to initiative. in terms of the interaction, we do get that initiative until we find that responsive, that first bit of responsive. We then obviously see the opposite side taking initiative, which runs into very, very short-term secondary responsive before seeing the continuation of initiative. We did cover that quite extensively. So again, make sure you build upon that interaction within this template. Do note it is a very aggressive interaction at most parts Obviously what I've included here is daily continuation requires the following now. We spoke a lot about how we can identify You know the potential for a trade the following session now bear in mind You know there were two strategies are two variations one is on the first day And the second was on day two and we spoke about ultimately in order for there to be continuation on day two We require a large relative tail in other words a weak close or a strong close, we also require cumulative totality in the direction of the reversal and then also a high relative daily volume. The reason for the high volume obviously was because when we have initiative it means there's high volume by nature, therefore initiative to initiative means there should be a really big amount of volume. Okay in terms of the metrics note when we have initiative as we mentioned in one of the earlier units Initiative does tend to hold consistency with the volume So you don't want to see low volume in terms of the metrics and do note you will most likely on a really good Reversal candle you will see probably one of the highest daily volumes You know recorded within a couple of you know days weeks months now in terms of time", "transcript": "in terms of volatility, it won't be excessive.

You know, you want to like I said, it's ideal to have the strategy on a time-based rotation Simply because you can see the really aggressive auctioning in the opposite Direction now we said time is crucial because time will reflect whether we get some symmetry in terms of the rejection And obviously if we have an engulfing candle, well, then we expect continuation on that engulfing or outside candle Within the next couple of time frames. So again, pay attention to time and do factors that into your into your analysis. In terms of Delta, it'll be light in the initiative for obvious reasons. We will see dark patches obviously with absorption and reloading. Now note up which stars they're next to absorption and reloading. I just want to really clarify the difference. Now absorption as I've utilized throughout this course is simply where You know if a market's going higher and suddenly someone starts to sell it, but a buyer holds higher prices He's simply absorbing the market at higher prices. We can also say it in terms of vice versa Now in terms of reloading there's a slight difference between absorption and reloading. Okay reloading Technically comes from the price ladder or the depth of the market and reloading simply means it's one order being reloaded So on the ladder you would see it says someone had a hundred lot contract and as someone begins selling Into that hundred lot contract or into that hundred lot bid Ultimately the buyer reloads it back up to a hundred and constantly reloads it Getting a fill of ultimately their long position. So that's the main difference between Reloading or absorption in effect. They do mean similar things. They are very very similar Absorption, however, I'd say technically happens over potentially more than one price. Okay, whereas Reloading tends to signal out one price. Okay in terms of then the the cumulative Delta We will obviously see accumulation in terms of the initiative and then obviously it will reverse as we get initiative in the opposite direction in terms of the relative change It will you know, we will see a relative change in price direction. That is the real key It's a sudden shift as prices move up to a sudden shift of prices moving down and that's that's the real nuance to the strategy It's knowing that interaction between the buyers and sellers and seeing it being reflected in the really in the relative change of price.
