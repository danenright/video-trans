Those will include the Anomaly strategies in Part 9, then Momentum strategies in Part 10, in Part 11 we'll discuss Trending strategies, and finally in Part 12 we'll discuss Reversal strategies. So the first of those, Anomaly strategies. category of strategies. And I'm going to define it by starting off with regards to the time frame players. Now, remember, anomaly strategies include things like low volume areas, bad highs, bad lows, high volume areas, anything that shows a distribution is not normal. So what you want to interpret is the following things. Firstly, what sort of time frame In this instance, you definitely don't want to see longer term time frame or swing time frame. You mostly want to see more short term time frames and algorithmic time frame players. The reason being is because these sorts of time frame players are not so influential on price. If we do see time frame players, it's highly unlikely the anomaly is actually going to get filled. That is why we'd rather see short term time frame players like algorithms and short in terms of initiative or responsive. Ideally, in order to see bad highs and bad lows go, we need to see more responsive type price action. We don't want to see too much initiative being taken. In terms of the time objective, how long do these anomalies take to finish? Well ideally, we'd prefer to finish within the day's time frame. Then in terms of volume and volatility, with anomaly type strategies we prefer to see lower volume and slightly less volatility. We don't want to see aggressive type price action as this could mean that maybe the anomaly is not going to get filled. And then lastly, or second to last, in terms of risk reward, we can define that anomaly strategies have got almost one-to-one type of risk reward and therefore we need to sometimes sit a little bit longer in these trades in order to get our desired objective. And lastly, there's very low momentum when it comes to anomaly strategies. So we don't want to be employing momentum type strategies, but rather almost sort of fading type strategies where we're looking to go against any initiative moves in one direction or the other. So let's now finally get to our two trade strategies that we're going to develop under the anomaly strategies. and the second is the High Volume Node Double Distribution.", "transcript": "As we go forward through the rest of Module 3, we're going to be discussing four unique categories of trade strategies.
