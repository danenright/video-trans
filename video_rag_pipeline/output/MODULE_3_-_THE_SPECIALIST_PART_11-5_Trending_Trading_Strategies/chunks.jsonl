So first and foremost, what sorts of time frame participants can you expect to see in trend trading strategies? Well, the big difference between trending trade strategies from momentum trade strategies is that trending tends to be initiative time frame only and it involves all time frames just like the momentum strategies. But the major difference is that when we see initiative in this one, it's initiative from all time frames. So everyone is either buying or everyone is either selling. very little other side, other time frame type participants. Remember what we said in momentum based strategies, sometimes the momentum can be created from a responsive other type frame that is being forced out of their positions. In this case, yes there are some other time frames being forced out of their positions, but everyone is going in the same direction and that's why this momentum is a lot more continuous. Now, in terms of the time objective, trending tends to occur over not just a couple of moments of the day, but for an entire day, a couple of weeks and sometimes even months and years. So it's important to understand when the markets are in a trending type condition so that you can employ your trending strategies not just for a couple of hours in the day, In terms of volume and volatility, we tend to see heightened volume and heightened volatility as well as range expansion during trending trade strategies. So note when you see relatively large shifts in the volume and ranges and relatively large changes you want to be aware and you want to begin employing trending type strategies. We then also talk about risk and reward. In trending type strategies the risk and reward is unlimited. If you get involved at the right areas with the right trade location and you interpret the beginning of a trend or even the middle phase of a trend, you can take risk-reward that is beyond imagination because in a trending-type strategy, the market will keep going and going and going until it manages to run into influential, responsive-type other players. In terms of momentum, it's crucial that you again interpret this trade category quite early on because the momentum is relatively aggressive and continuous for some period of time. Let's now try and define momentum a little bit better. Now, momentum means pretty much price discovery mode, it's when the market moves away from their value and it begins to move in the direction of price discovery.", "transcript": "Now, before we get onto the trend type strategies that we're going to develop with you in part 11, let's try and define them in terms of those key characteristics again.

Let's now try and define momentum a little bit better. Now, momentum means pretty much price discovery mode, it's when the market moves away from their value and it begins to move in the direction of price discovery. We tend to get very little price overlap, so when there's momentum in the market, we don't see much overlap of price, prices hang around for a little while before progressing Reference points tend to have very little technical importance. So if ever you see a market sort of taking out a lot of key technical areas or key reference points you'd identify, that's a very early identifier that there is momentum in the market and flow. Also, all timeframes initiate in the same direction, so true trend-like momentum, every one is in agreement as to price direction. And lastly, just be aware of the bias trap. In other words, what often happens is when there is momentum or trend in the market, we tend to get almost stuck in a rut that a market can only go one way. Now, whilst this is a very, very good thing in a sense that if a market is trending higher, we only initiate buy-side trades, we always need to remember that there is always a risk attached to whatever we're doing. It doesn't matter if a market's trending higher. There is always the likelihood or the probability it could reverse and reverse very quickly. So when you're employing these trend-like strategies or there's strong momentum in the market, always have what we like to call a line in the sand. and this is the point at which the momentum or the trend is no longer valid.
