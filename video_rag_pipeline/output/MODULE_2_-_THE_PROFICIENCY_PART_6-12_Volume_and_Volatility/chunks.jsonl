We're going to talk about volume and volatility, and I'm going to show you how to use these two tools. to your advantage, not just in volume profiling, but in any trading. So what we're going to talk about firstly is volume. Now remember what we said, volume is showing us how good or how successful the auction process is taking place. trade. So, if there is a high amount of volume, the market's doing a good job. Why? Because it's facilitating buyers and sellers, or it's facilitating a high amount of trade. So, Volume on its own means nothing. It tells us nothing. If you just look at volume, you have high volume, you have low volume, that does not tell us anything about future prices. We need to see the advertisement of prices with the volume to have any kind of meaningful High volume means trade is being facilitated well, low volume means there's a high probability for mean reversion. In other words, remember we said volume is like force. When there's a lot of force in the market, we should be seeing prices move aggressively Okay, if it's not moving aggressive or if it is moving aggressively up and down but on lower volume It's very likely that we're going to revisit those prices at some point Why because it's not new business taking those prices up or down So the fact that it's not new business means it's highly likely that we do retest those prices again at some point now notes Volume is a relative tool. So it's all about understanding how volume is changing over a given period of time. So what I mean by that, if you're sitting, and let's take for example a weekly type strategy where the market's moving relatively sideways on lower volume, all of a sudden on any given day the market volume doubles what we've seen over the average of the last 10 trading sessions. This... very aggressive relative change in volume is telling us that new business is being brought into the market. Now how it impacts prices is all determined on a number of factors like trade location and where we are trading within a bracket and all sorts of things. So on its own it doesn't mean something but the fact that there is a strong relative change in volume, that is something we want to identify and pay attention to. But then just some of the things I would use volume for and I'd pay attention to is, as you can see in the example provided, I've got two colours there. I've got a red line and an orange line on the volume bars.", "transcript": "Two concepts that a lot of people like to use, but more often they don't understand, is volume and volatility.

Now that for me is showing what is relatively high or relatively low volume based on a previous number of sessions and I identify that because it's easy for me to then see when all of a sudden there's a high amount of volume or new business coming Equally, I have moving averages on the volume so I can see how on average the volume is changing and I can see if there's a sudden relative shift in volume. in terms of the volume. Sometimes volume will be sitting in, say, doing roughly 20,000 contracts every half hour for a number of half hours. So if you know what the average is and then the sudden shift, you can quickly pick up on the shift in the relative change that is occurring within the volume. And more importantly, you can then develop strategies So, to finish, remember high relative volume is indicative of initiative being taken from the buyers or the sellers which happen to be influential participants. So when you see a relatively strong shift in the volume towards the upside, we can see a little bit of initiative coming into the market and then we need to be cautious going against that initiative and that is why we sort of talk a lot about volume quite extensively.
