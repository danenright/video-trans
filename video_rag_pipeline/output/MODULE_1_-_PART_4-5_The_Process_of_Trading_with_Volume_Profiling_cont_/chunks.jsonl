What you can see in the chart provided is four days of volume profiling in the Euro Dollar FX chart. Now, this is dated the 25th of October 2016, so you can go get this chart yourself. However, let's just have a brief little rundown of what we see in front of us. So, the market has been consolidating, overlapping value areas. We've had 3 days in a row where the market closes within 10 pips of the previous close. We have a similar volume point of control, implying excessively balanced. We have smaller ranges with 70% of the volume transacted over a 25 pip range. On day 4 as illustrated, the buyers show initiative and post a drive out of and away from fair price. A strong sell tail forms at R after an aggressive 50 pip move up and that's effectively So as you can see that just puts everything into context for us. What we then do is we then go through our three step process. Now step one, we identify the key volume profile metrics. Basically you take the template provided in your playbook and you complete it. So you analyse on day three the high, the low, the range, the initial balance, the volume point of control etc etc so you complete your template provided. Once you've completed the template and the reason you complete the template is because you're going to pick up on some very specific things when completing the template. For example, If you complete the template every single day, you'll very quickly begin to realize when the range is expanding. If you know on day one the range was 40 ticks, on day two the range was 30 ticks, and day three the range was 20 ticks, you'll very quickly pick up on a trend developing within the market you're trading. This is why we do these analytics every single day, to ensure that we pick up on these trends when they are occurring. Once you've identified all the key volume profile metrics, you then do step 2, which is a Subjective vs Objective analysis. In the next slide, we are going to do this. Step 3 would be to identify the volume profile anomalies. Now as you can see, some of the anomalies that exist in this consolidated chart, if In other words, the market tested this high four times.", "transcript": "Now that we've gone through the three basic steps of utilising your volume profiles, we're now going to take a basic example and we're going to go through each one of those steps individually.

Now remember back in part three we spoke about this anomaly. We spoke about how it's very unusual for a high of a day to be tested four times and not be broken. Therefore by that token we are very aware that the high posted on day one is likely to be broken at some point in the future. Another anomaly to point out is on day 4, when we finally break out of the day 3 range, we can see an untraded or a low volume area. This is a second anomaly. The third anomaly is on day 3.
