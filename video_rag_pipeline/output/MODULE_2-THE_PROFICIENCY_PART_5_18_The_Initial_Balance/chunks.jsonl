Before we get started with talking about the initial balance, I think I need to paint a little bit of a picture of maybe what the markets used to be like as they sort of became electronic. Now the important thing to understand is that the markets never used to be almost 24 hours. Nowadays, you can pretty much trade around the clock in most markets. When the initial balance or the concept of the initial balance was first developed back in the pit days, it used to include the first hour of trade when there were only, for instance, eight or nine hours of trade in a day. It did play a far more important role back in the day, however, it still offers very early opportunity and information for us and that's why we need to understand the initial balance and some of the patterns we can recognize from the initial balance. So what is the initial balance? It's simply the pre-cash session. Now we will go through our four markets that we trade or that we speak about throughout the course, which are the E-Mini S&P 500, the German Buns, the WTI Oil and the Euro Dollar FX. So I will show you four charts of what the initial balance will look like, but it's take what I say as the most important thing. What's important is understanding the logic and the principle behind why we look at the initial balance. So the initial balance is the pre-cash session. The session before the cash market opens is known as the initial The entire overnight session for US products and the overnight session of the FX and commodities markets now remember Obviously European markets do shut the futures do shut so when they open the very next morning That first hour of trade before or the trade before the cash markets come in that period is the initial balance With regards to US products they trade overnight now Obviously the cash markets are shut at that point, so that period from where the futures trade up until the point that the cash begins to trade, that period is known as the initial balance period. And then obviously with regards to the FX or commodity markets, the same is because they 24 hours predominantly, the session from the overnight all the way up until So, any future session that does not include the cash markets will be the initial balance or the overnight session.

So a lot of the time you'll hear professionals talking about the overnight session or the overnight market. So that is the period when the cash is shut. The initial balance represents the earliest reference points on the day and that is why it's closely watched. They create important early pivots for us. The initial balance is the first opportunity for traders to liquidate, hedge and initiate trade after the market has been shut. So again, this is more relevant to the European markets because they tend to shut for a lot longer. So, you know, if they're shutting from 9pm at night till 7am the next morning, there's a good 10 hour period in which very little can be done to hedge or to take on or to and there's a lot of time to strategize and make early decisions. Again, that's why we tend to focus a lot more on initial balance strategies in the European session, but you do get some very important strategies in the US session too, and the commodities and equities and the FX, and that is why we are actually teaching you about the initial balance. Then, initial balance, they do traditionally imply low volume, so what you would typically find is low volume, lack of liquidity in the overnight or initial balance. Now this is a crucial element to understand because if this is the norm, if this is the tradition, if this is what we usually see, when we see something else, i.e. volatility or volume, then you need to be switched on because it's giving you very early identifiers lies. Again, the initial balance, relative strategies are highly effective. What we mean by that is, if you're used to the initial balance trading say 10,000 contracts on average every single morning, that morning that you see 30 or 40,000 contracts, you need to be switched on because something has changed. Their relative indicators are telling us that something has changed, there's early action in the market. The same can be said for the range. there we've got the volume and we note the average volume, so when it spikes above the average volume we know there's potential for opportunity.
