However, Technical gaps, these do tend to fill and more often than not they do get filled on the same day or the days thereafter. Now let's have a quick look and talk about some of the key characteristics when it comes to the gap fill strategy. First and foremost we need to understand the gap implies the market is out of balance. When a market is out of balance, this implies skewed risk as well as skewed opportunity. So straight away you should be saying to yourself, well if we have a gap, we have got an element of risk but equally we've got a much bigger element or much larger opportunity for upside. Now the key to being successful at trading gap days is to always first and foremost manage your risk. Now let's have a quick look at some of the emotional analysis when it comes to gap days. Remember as a result of the excess volatility you can expect to see much bigger movements Now, with that in mind, don't forget, traders are not used to going a long way or side. Traders are not used to the markets moving aggressively in one direction or another. So by that very definition, make sure you understand the various types of emotions you might experience within the reversal type strategies. Remember I said we're looking for the key identifier. Well here it is. So when it comes to a gap day, there are three basic rules. Rule number one, does the market fill the gap? If so, we give it a tick. Rule number two, does the market re-enter the previous day's range? Now, at this point, we have not yet seen our key identifier. In other words, we have not even initiated a trade.

So the first thing before we discuss the trade opportunity is to interpret what happens on a gap day. Well very simply put, we've obviously had a huge surge in volatility, something has shifted the outlook of the markets, and all of a sudden the buyers and sellers are scrambling as price has shifted significantly. Now, what tends to occur is the market gaps open and we tend to see a hive of volatility very early on. Now straight away there's a natural tendency when a market gaps for a bias to be in the market. Now bias means nothing more than positioning or at least short-term positioning. It's this very short-term positioning that is going to give us our gap day, gap fill So, what happens? The market comes up, rule number one, it retests and fills the gap. Rule number two, it re-enters the previous day's range. And number three, if it re-enters the previous day's value area low, bang, our control identify has been initiated and we look for long side trades to target the top Now, the understanding and the logic behind this trade strategy is very simple. Because of the bias in the market, we know there are natural short positions that are shorting with the gap to the downside.

As you can see in the example provided, the market has gapped higher on the day, higher than the previous day's range. It opens and we see an element of volatility and two-way trade. The gap is filled, so rule number one is ticked. rule number two is ticked. We then re-enter this blue line which is the value area high and we then execute our short trades looking to target the value area low where we cover. Once we enter the market aggressively below the value area high, we merely place our stop the equivalent of our target. Now, there is another way we can place our stop. We can also place our stop based on the point from the value error high or low to the previous day's extreme, as in this example illustrated. Now, the key to understanding is, yes, we are going counter-trend, but with using the current positioning in the market, as in this example there's short-term long positions, the unwind of that will give us the desired momentum in order to take advantage of the quick unwind of positions. As you could see in the second example with the German Buns, note how the market opens lower so we gap lower on the day. We have a relatively volatile initial period. The market then fills rule number one and we close the gap. We then re-enter rule number two, whereby we retest or re-enter the previous day's range. Rule number three, we re-enter the value area low where we initiate our long trades looking to target the value area high. Note again, this is our target, we look to put our stop below the previous day's low or equivalent to the target used. That is our second example of the gap day gap fill. Make sure you understand not just the importance of reversal strategies but why they can be highly effective so long as we place emphasis on managing the risk. It's okay to go against the trend.
