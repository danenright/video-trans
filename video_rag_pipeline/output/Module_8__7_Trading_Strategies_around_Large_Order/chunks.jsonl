Your ability to interpret that will determine the success of your trade and that's only a process of observation and experience and and solid deliberate learning. We're going to be looking at a couple of strategies in the next slide on some videos But we're going to be looking at you know, some some front running strategies and the main ones really is as I mentioned before The explosive one tick front run. It's the it's the it's the fill and run So the moment you see that large order So for example on the previous slide We saw that 2000 at the moment that comes in you determine that's that's a genuine order you place a bit directly above it the moment you get filled you get out for a tick or three ticks and and so really the mathematics of that trade is you're leveraging your size in order to get the full, given the type of liquidity environment that you have and a lot of times large orders come in when the markets in that high state of panic and the moment you see it sometimes large orders start chasing the book up the page and you'll get it sometimes when there's an OPEC breaking meeting on crude oil when all of a sudden you see a large order come to the market a thousand lot and what you do you place an order just above it so a thousand lot comes in on the buy side you place an order and then you get filled and the market moves up then all of a sudden the thousand lot is not being filled that chases up the market again it's not getting full so you you run in front of that order sometimes you can get a quick 20 tick move when you notice a large order not being filled those are sometimes the best trades when a large order excuse me is not being filled Then there's the front-run position after a fast sprint. We won't be looking at a video. I'd rather let you find this in the marketplace but effectively what that is is if you've had a large order sitting at a particular price all day and therefore kind of ticks the box of a genuine order, what you're effectively looking for is if you see the market moving 60 ticks, say in this instance in the oil market, moving incredibly quickly towards an order.

If that market is moving very order there's a very strong likelihood that the market will bounce directly off their large order because it's not moving towards slowly it's not building time above their large order because the moment you build time there is there is there is a lot of energy for the market to trade through it because it's it's building a good structure above it so when a market almost vacuums towards the level moves fast it's easier to bounce because it's moving from far where whereas when it's moving slowly towards it and builds above it it's not going to bounce as quickly but it's not bouncing from far it's from close. So those fast sprint large order trades are some that don't exist too often but when you observe them they are great trading strategies and high probability plays. then there's the hiding behind the elephant trade so once the large order has been identified and the large order you know the front run starts failing and all of sudden you start seeing participants hitting that large order or that large order starts disintegrating with with trades that are going through it the moment you see the large order just about to disappear you have to react quickly enough by in this instance say the large orders of 2,000 lots sitting at a bit at 50 the market is bouncing that large order the moment it trades the moment it trades out the market blips down the moment it blips down on the balance probability what happens is it blips down because everyone's having to start covering who are front running it blips down and then you have to wait until you find that first little absorption zone which will be talking on on the in later on in the module the moment the market blips down and you see the market starting to reload order, you bid it and then invariably the market retests where that large order was taken out. So that's called the hiding behind the elephant and we'll be looking at that in the next video after this slide. And then you can get synthetic skulls via TT. You can have more automated strategies such as you can have the same type of hiding behind the elephant or if you hit the large order, so for example if you're looking disappears uh the large order disappears and the market blips down as soon as you hit that larger as soon as you get filled you have an automatic exit so the moment you get filled you put an automatic exit for that quick for that quick fill because the market could react And then we talk about the hit and run plus a quick synthetic exit So the hit-and-run strategy is you observe the large order the large order People are unable to front-run the large order the large order is now being traded out You join as that large order gets taken out", "transcript": "particular price all day and therefore kind of ticks the box of a genuine order, what you're effectively looking for is if you see the market moving 60 ticks, say in this instance in the oil market, moving incredibly quickly towards an order.
