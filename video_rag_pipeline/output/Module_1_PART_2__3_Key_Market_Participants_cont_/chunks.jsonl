The major difference between the speculator and the commercial participant is that the commercial participant tends to interact in the market and hold positions based on various fundamentals or various technicals and they do tend to hold these toward maturity. Whereas the speculator, they tend to hold until a profit target has been reached, or an objective, a specific objective has been reached. They speculate on the direction of price, whether up or down, and take advantage of that. Once it has occurred, once the advantage has been taken, they then exit the position. So, what are some of the characteristics that define speculative participants? Well, first and foremost, speculative participants can be short or long term or even algorithmic. They tend to move price between longer term players, in other words, they tend to facilitate trade between the longer term participants. They bring the longer term participants into the market by moving price up and down. What do we mean by this? Well, when prices move up or down, speculative positions tend to be unwound or put back on. Because they are price sensitive in nature, they can sometimes also move the market quite aggressively in one direction or the other. We will discuss various strategies based on speculative positioning later on in the course. Speculators tend to position with risk in mind so they tend to enter at one point but they do have a point where they exit the position or take the opposite side of the position to get out. Again important to understand as sometimes it's speculators that are moving prices up and down as opposed to paper commercial participants. Speculators tend to take advantage or trade short-term anomalies within the market. Again, once that anomaly has been taken out of the market, they tend to exit those positions. Speculators tend to be non-influential in price, so they can move price but not in the same aggressive manner that commercial paper can move the price. Again important to understand because sometimes what happens is speculative paper might move the market too far in one direction as a result of stops going off and once those stops are taken out we do tend to then see a rapid rebound in prices. So again important to understand as we will discuss strategies based on this at Now, let's talk about the third key participant, the Automated Algorithmic Strategy or ALGOs. Again, important to understand the key characteristic that make up these algorithms.", "transcript": "Let's now continue with the second of our key market participants, the speculator.

So again important to understand as we will discuss strategies based on this at Now, let's talk about the third key participant, the Automated Algorithmic Strategy or ALGOs. Again, important to understand the key characteristic that make up these algorithms. Note, algorithms by their very nature are very short term and they tend to make up roughly 90% of the trade in most markets. Now it's key to understand this, if 90% of the trade is made up with short-term algorithms, we need to focus quite heavily on what their objectives and goals are of algorithms, because we are going to be participating predominantly with these algorithms. So another characteristic, their execution methodology is precise with exact entry and exit parameters. What this means is that they very rarely make mistakes, they very rarely Yes, sometimes it does occur that they do, such as the flash crash, however, in general they are very precise with their execution methodology. Algorithms tend to speculate using high frequency, so they do a lot of trades very rapidly in and out, in and out. They tend to have very small downside with open-ended upside. So again, very often we can see markets sometimes moving very quickly in one direction and then reversing the trade, and this is more just noise or positioning unwinding happening within algorithms. Algorithms look to fill orders at best price practice within parameters. So again, algos are after the best possible price and because they can rapidly execute these orders a lot quicker than us, we need to understand their methodology in order to assist us in developing our own edge. So important we understand this because it means that as a day trader, our edge is not necessarily disappears but it's eroded by an algorithm or computer that can execute far better and far more efficiently than what we can. So again, important to understand this as we develop our edge as a trader. So the key when it comes to trading market participants. We need to be able to answer the following. objectives, execution styles, time horizons of the various participants. If we can answer these four dynamics and understand the characteristics of each participant, we can develop some incredibly good strategies, just knowing how each participant is interacting", "transcript": "stops are taken out we do tend to then see a rapid rebound in prices.
