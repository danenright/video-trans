Let's start off with an analogy a Formula one driver is going to be shifting his gears in different ways when he's approaching bends as opposed to straights. When he's going around bends he's gonna be shifting his gears down from five to four to three as he rounds the bend and he finds a really strong and powerful straight for the next two miles he's gonna be shifting into fifth gear as quickly as possible getting the rev count up as quickly as possible in order bends in the marketplace by judging the obstacles of different types of order strategies and execution strategies that are going on in the market. So really key and critically important that the ability to judge the market environment and the velocity that's going through the order book, the auctioning activity, the speed of orders is really going to help determine how you're going to structure So you really have to reconcile the technical landscape with the level of market velocity and that's the conviction of your trades. So again, this is so important to understand is you can have some great technical trend lines and when the market breaches that technical trend line and until that trend line is breached with great order of velocity and activity, are you going to start committing to that market? trend line break but all that happens is a couple of stops go off and just Buyers are being pulled if it's a trend line break towards the downside but it's not if it's not being met by increased in auctioning activity or there's just someone on the buy side absorbing all the new orders Well, then you're able to not only get out of your original short But potentially turn your position around and go for the buy side because you know There's potentially some trapped as sellers on this trade and it's the speed of orders that are going through and whether there is someone On the other side of the trade is really important. So understanding the velocity landscape to determine the level of engagement. So when when there's a lot of order speed going through and like we discussed in the previous video of what that really looks like it's going to determine the level of engagement between buyers and sellers and if there is engagement from the buyers and sellers and We'll be looking at this throughout the entire program and course when you look at all our various types of trading strategies. And it's the ability not to be mis-presented by the charts and the juiciness of the chart can, effectively you can identify early charting traps such as ledgers. One of the classic play that I've always enjoyed on the market profile is when you have the very heavy profile top, you're looking to buy into it very aggressively.", "transcript": "Let's now discuss how market velocity can help structure your trades now.

One of the classic play that I've always enjoyed on the market profile is when you have the very heavy profile top, you're looking to buy into it very aggressively. At times if I get the right market velocity environment towards a ledge I will look for only three or four tick break But I'll be doing it with my max clip because the probability of those four ticks happening whether if you time it appropriately For me out of all the times I traded is 95% So out of those times I have to make sure I expose as much size Even though I'm only looking for three or four ticks I want to do it with as much as larger size as I can as opposed to some people look at conviction of of how far a market can go. I'll tell you a story of one of my very good friends, an incredible Euro stocks trader who used to trade and get away, you know, anything between two to. 4,000 lots in the market and about eight nine years ago I remember a whole bunch of us were walking past him during lunch time and and lunch times are unknown where the market Becomes lethargic and becomes really tired and we walk past his desk. We noticed that he had a 3,000 lots in the euro stocks and we said like what's going on here? This is why you've got so much size There's nothing really happening. There's there's nothing going on and you really expose yourself and he said no he said I know I've got a 98% chance of making one tick on this trade. So therefore, if he felt he had a 90% chance of making one tick on this trade, he would put as much leverage and his max clip on the trade. Because if he does that 10 times, he knows what he's going to be up. And it's the same with the great front-running trading strategies. And we look at that in the order book they're only looking for one tick but highly leveraged with their size so really important but now if a chart is showing you a beautiful ledge and you wanting to buy it with great momentum but the velocity is not there it starts approaching that that level with with no activity becomes really slow and maybe even takes out the high but with no activity you're not going to be exposing yourself as much because the market is not showing the right activity, it's showing you a lethargy action, it's showing you there's no one around in the neighborhood to engage with, to buy or sell with. And therefore what happens with that is that the market starts dripping back down. And if you go in with MaxClip without the right market environment, you're really gonna expose yourself and expose your risk to a quick unraveling of the market to the downside.
