Now before I actually move in and we begin this unit, I just want to make sure that you guys recognize the importance of a trading tool. Don't allow unit four to almost distract you ultimately from the true purpose of a trading tool. Okay? Remember the objective of a trading tool is to extract information from the marketplace in a meaningful manner so we can make decisions. Okay?

What I don't want is I don't want to over complicate. create noise for you ultimately with this unit. I just want to show you some of the more advanced things you can do with the Footprint tool so that when you are developing your own strategies in time, if some of these functions can add value to those strategies, by all means utilize them. What you've got in front of you, these are my notes, so what I'm going to do is I'm just going to briefly scroll down on these notes for you guys so that you can have just a brief moment to see what we're going to talk about. You can take maybe some pictures of these notes, maybe even record these notes for future reference, but I will be effectively going through each one of these utilizing the Footprint tool. Okay, so we're going to start off obviously with managing the tool, talk a little bit about setup and chart fonts, as well as chart colors, printing the magnet tool, as well as rescaling certain studies and different chart options. We're then going to talk in the second section about footprint chart settings and tabs. We're then going to move on to the footprint functionality, what style to use, etc, etc. And then we're going to obviously finish Unit 3 with backtesting before the advanced footprint settings where we talk about highlighting conditional formatting, adding certain price alerts and then obviously modifications you can make to the general footprint tool. Okay, so that's pretty much what we're going to talk about now. Let's get straight into it again I'm going to go through each one of these step for step, so don't worry, okay? Where to begin so this is now, you know, obviously we spoke in unit two about setting up the basic elements of your footprint chart So this is more or less what you should have in front of you now very very basic just a simple footprint chart You know, maybe your colors are different to mine.

So you can see if we came to the chart preferences we can start off here by looking at some of the the defaults that it's currently set to. Okay so just very briefly obviously grid lines that is something that annoys certain traders and it doesn't annoy other traders. For me I quite like having some sort of grid lines maybe a solid major and minor division and if I apply you'll see simply it's just creating some form of a scale on the In terms of other things you can have a look at, what I would say is obviously just make sure... Just make sure that, in terms of the labels and values, make sure that if you want display boxes, as you can see in the top left and the bottom left corners, if you want those display boxes, you can see that we've got them listed here under display value box. So you can untick them if you want and simply remove them. And again, a lot of this is just play around. It's more preference more than anything. So if you want it there, include it. If you don't, don't. Obviously as you're making changes in terms of the setup here, this will be your default settings as you go through. One of the last things to pay attention to is this button called continuation. It is quite important now. Continuation is just simply, obviously when futures contracts roll over, in other words they move into the forward dated month, continuation will effectively continue showing you the price and it will automatically show you the market or the month that's trading Okay, now obviously you can see the system default is to have no continuation. In other words, what will happen is you will have your chart come the end of the month, will stop showing data or it won't roll itself automatically. So for me, I suggest you unclick the no continuation and again I would suggest that you go and click the active rollover when trading activity and optionally equalize closes. the contract will automatically roll, the software will automatically put you in the front month as soon as the volume in the front month is more than the volume in the current month. So for me I recommend that, obviously there are other options you can utilize but we're going to utilize active rollover in terms of when the volume moves.

This is now simply if you want to change the text If you want to change the size of the text, make something bold, etc. etc. This is where you would do all that. If you don't like it and you make a few boo-boos and you want to go back, obviously you can always come in the bottom left and restore to the original default. Again, what I would say is don't spend a great deal of time playing with these things. Just find something that looks okay and save it and then move on. Now, one of the features that's really good about this tool is that when you do find a feature that you really like, let's say for instance you've created all your charts, you've been utilizing it for a couple of months and then you all of a sudden want to make a change to all of your charts or some of your charts, you can simply come in as bottom right here and you can apply it to this chart on this page, you can apply it to all your charts on this page, you can apply it to all your charts on all pages and you can apply it to all new charts. you can make changes relatively easy on all your charts, some of your charts, some of your pages, etc. So don't worry if right now you don't get everything perfectly, at a later stage you can come back and make changes across all of your charts in one go as opposed to having to do them all individually. Let's go back to setup again. This time we're going to talk about some of the chart colors. Now, what I'm going to say, the first thing to pay attention to is when you start looking at the colors, just remember the Footprint tool is very much a contrast tool. In other words, it's a tool where we want to see contrast quite easily. Now that's why I either utilize a black background or a white background because I really want to see those contrasts as aggressively as possible. And then again, in terms of your scale text, your right and left text, that's all these things. So on your right side you've got prices, you've got time at the bottom, and you've got all your grid lines. Those are pretty much these sort of three boxes here. You've obviously got your grid lines which are white, and you've got a whole bunch of other things lower down that you can play with. What I suggest you do is go through each one of them, click on it, choose push apply and see what happens. That's simply the best way to determine what each one of those boxes do and familiarize yourself with what the changes can do. And again, obviously, if you only want to make a change to this chart, all your charts, some of your charts, you've got that functionality on the right side.

What the demo trading is going to allow you to do is it's going to allow you to effectively trade alongside On your footprint, okay So you can see how you've obviously got a bid and an offer and these are the live prices as you can see Yeah on the bottom right. These are the live prices of the current WTI oil price So, you know whilst the strategy is in play, you know, you can effectively trade alongside it simply at the click of a button Now what I will say most important guys Do not be distracted by this tool. This is something that you only really want to start paying attention to as you move on towards the strategy section. What I would advise is completely eliminate this functionality until you start unit 6-15. And just make sure that you're not, when you're going through obviously the coursework and you're doing your practice sessions and your drill sessions, you rather just don't have this here because what it's going to do is, one, it's going to distract you, you're going to feel the urge to suddenly apply a strategy that you might not necessarily completely understand yet. But two, what it might do is it might just draw upon your old ways of thinking. You might just look at a chart and there might be some support and you might be like, well let me just buy it, it's a trial. play around. So important, this trial with the free simulator, effectively you want to utilize that in a manner where you can practice the strategies that you're learning. Okay, so if you remember in the 30-day challenge, as I explained in unit one, and hopefully you've printed off, on your practice days, after every unit where we discuss and develop a new strategy, the very next day is a practice session. In those sessions, when you've done the drill work, you've found a couple of examples. By all means, feel free to have a footprint up, just like we've got here, and feel free to simply buy and sell accordingly. Okay, that's how I would advise you to use the demo trading.

However obviously if you're someone that's a little bit paper conscious and you prefer to not waste paper, you can simply get a snipping tool. Now if you go to your start on your computer and you type in snipping tool you'll find that most computers nowadays have some form of a snipping tool and you can simply just go new and you can simply just select the region you want, draw all over it, make a nice tick, talk about certain imbalances etc etc, right click, copy the picture and paste it into either a Word document or as you'll see an Evernote document as Okay, then in terms of the next tool. This is called a magnet tool. Now... The magnet tool is something that works particularly well, not so much in the footprint, but what it does effectively is a lot of the time when we select a line, for instance as I've done here, we might not get close enough to the price we're looking at, maybe to a previous high or a previous low or maybe a trend line. So what the magnet does is it effectively, it attaches itself, so if I'm hovering maybe As soon as you click on it you can set the level of magnetism within the tool and you can see it asks for magnet strength. It's advised that you set it at at least 50. This makes it relatively sensitive and will at least find the price that it's looking for. For the footprint, it's better suited to the candlestick charts, so we won't really be utilizing it much in the footprint tool. Now something that really came of interest to me, and I'm going to share this with you, I'm going to bring back the Evernote, is that, okay, for me, I'd never known what the magnet button did. Now, this is the wonderful thing about this charting package is that it's got an incredibly useful amount of assistance. So as you can see I've got a nice little picture here and all I did to go and understand what this tool did and again I might not explain everything very well to you but in that case you've got a wonderful info tool so if you want to get more information You can simply come up to the support in the top right here. You can go and open the help and you'll see a nice toolbar like this will pop up and as soon as you get this up you can just go and type in the search function here and type in magnet.

Now, as I will explain to you at the end again, there are two other options for you in terms of support. You can obviously go and talk to the live chat, those are the people on the support of CQG Market Delta, and they will assist you in terms of any kind of questions. But also what's very, very useful is you'll see a lot of the charting package. and all sorts of information will come up as we're hovering over it. The same will be as you go through various tools. When you hover over it, it will give a nice brief explanation of effectively what the tool is doing. So here you can see we hovered over a profile, it says change pointer tool to profile area. And this will be the same for all these sorts of bars on the left, add a study it says in terms of magnets, it says to us turn on the magnet. What we're going to move on to is then some of the other tools that you can find here.

If you want to switch, you can go to a bar chart very quickly, you can come back You know, we can do all sorts of things, we can move, we can go and add maybe a volume weighted average price and it will very quickly add the study onto the footprint.

I'm going to keep all of our markets, for instance, in one long tab, and again the reason I prefer it this way is because I feel if you have, again if we go back, if we had say three of these, you can see very quickly how you can be drawn into too much information.

Now I'm going to go through them and I'm going to plot them on the chart for you and show you how to change them. So I effectively have seven different colors. Now again you don't have to adopt these color scheme. You can adopt your own color scheme. You might not even like the idea or the principle behind the color scheme. But the reason I have it's very simple. Every one of these colors is identifying something for me so that I can effectively execute one of the 10 strategies you're going to learn. Now for me, brown colors represent daily highs and lows. So whenever there's a daily high and low in my debrief the previous day, I go and put those brown lines in to show me the daily high and low. Now obviously that's very effective for breakout trading or for extensions on previous days highs or maybe potential imbalance strategies. In terms of pink, you'll see a bright pink simply indicates the weekly high and low. In terms of red, these are just very important reference points, so any kind of points of reference that I thought were valid from the previous day, let's say for instance we had a key economic data piece, European CPI, I would always put a reference point that was left as a result of that economic data, okay? Again, the reason I do this is just that it's a reference point, it's drawing my attention to this having been quite an important reference on economic data. Then orange, I utilize for high absorption, again, you know, I've spoken a little bit about this in Unit 3, what absorption is, what it looks like, and you'll see me talk about this extensively throughout the strategy sessions. So for me, I use orange to signal where there's been some really high absorption or really, really big delta shifts in price. Okay, in terms of dark blue, this would signal really key breakout areas. Now when we talk about the breakout strategy right towards the end of the course, you know obviously this, you know, breakouts, we tend to use a couple of different charts, not just a footprint. So for me, identifying the breakouts, I always like to put a nice dark blue line. So that signals number one, I don't want to go against the break of that blue line. But equally, I want to make sure that when that break occurs, I'm watching that price action around the blue line quite closely. Turquoise shows us where there's an initiative.

When we get to the actual strategy session on imbalances, you're going to understand this very well and how it effectively works. Okay, so let's go and apply these now. Let's go and show you how to apply these lines. Very simply, let's say this was the high of the previous day in terms of 58.60, in fact what I'm going to do is I'm going to show you how to apply lines quite quickly. So if we quickly go on to a time-based session here, if I went to modify and I simply went to the source, I can see it's on bar which means I can make it time-based. Now if you want to quickly put in weekly high-low, daily high-low, maybe some come and right click on here, change the interval to a daily or a weekly. So we can see currently we've got the set to a daily. So very simply I can go put a line there and a line at the top and I can see now the low of oil yesterday was 57.44 and the high was 58.12. Now in terms of weekly I can do the same thing. I can right click, chart interval and go weekly. Obviously at the moment this footprint is only available on intraday or daily to the daily, and if we get the weekly out here, you can see obviously the day now is Thursday, so it's Thursday, Wednesday, Tuesday, and Monday. This is obviously last week's low and this was last week's high. So again, we can go and right click on the line now, we can go and set the horizontal color and make it nice and pink. Okay, and we can do the same for the pink. So straight away you've got the daily high and low, you've got the weekly high and low. Now let's say for instance this was an important reference point, maybe that's the point that the WTI oil inventory data came out and we can simply leave that red line there. We can then go and put an orange line, so let's go find, we saw obviously yesterday we absorbed 20,000 or almost 40,000 contracts at price point 71, so we can go and make then we can go and obviously put a dark blue. So obviously this 5860 is a very important level. We can see it's a it's been a really big turning point in the market and we had some big rejection. So this might be some really important reference point or a breakout point. So we're going to make a nice dark blue color and we put it right next to the pink line. So we can see a really important area developing there. We can then go look for some initiatives. So we can see the market really initiated off as high as well. We can see some real low volume areas here and we can sort of go and look and say, well maybe price point 41, that's where it initiated from, that's where the sellers stepped in in an aggressive manner.
