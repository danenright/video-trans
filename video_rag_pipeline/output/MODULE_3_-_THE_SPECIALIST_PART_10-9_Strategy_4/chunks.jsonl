Now, the important thing you must remember is that momentum strategies can sometimes be relatively obvious. So, with that in mind, if it's an obvious trade strategy, you have to be very, very smart when developing the various characteristics and preconditions in order for you to execute. Now, the reason you need to be very smart is because momentum strategies bring with them almost an element of perfect risk-reward. So, what do I mean by that? With momentum strategies, by definition, if we are entering on what we perceive as momentum, the risk is relatively small. We can define that risk as the moment a market no longer shows the characteristic of momentum, we merely exit. This trade strategy is very favorable, not just amongst day traders, but amongst algorithms and many other participants. So with that in mind, it's imperative that when you develop these characteristics and rules and preconditions, you are very specific as to what you want to execute based on your interpretation and understanding. So with that in mind, let's get into the next of our momentum type strategies, which is the initial balance break out, you know, where we have a confluence in the market. Now I really love this idea of confluence, and I'm going to explain to you what I mean by confluence. Well, confluence is nothing other than where we have multiple reference points that align with one another. So what do I mean by it? a weekly high, and we also have a daily high, and now we have a 60-minute high. So we're trading at a price of the weekly high, a daily high, and a 60-minute high, and all three of these happen to align at the exact same price. Now, all of a sudden, we have an area of confluence where a number of participants are looking at the same area for varying reasons. So some might be looking at it, you know, that we may get a little bit of longer term influential players stepping in once we break out the weekly high. We may have the short term algorithms looking to play for a break out once we take out the 60 minute high. And we may have some day traders or swing traders looking to initiate long trades So, all three of these different levels bring in all the various timeframe participants. As a result, these confluence levels tend to be wonderful trigger points or very important reference points.

As a result, these confluence levels tend to be wonderful trigger points or very important reference points. Now, make sure when you define, once you obviously understand confluence, make sure you then understand the definition of a reference point. A point or a price in the market only becomes a reference point if there is some sort of influence or influential player that is willing to step in beyond that point. So let's take an example. Let's say the market has left a high and rotated off low, and this has remained the high for, say, 2016. So it's the all-time high, it's the high of 2016. Now, once we return to this resistance reference point, the market or there will be a lot of participants paying attention to this point. They won't necessarily be looking for shorts, but they will be paying attention to see what the response is at this reference point, whether maybe we find a seller step-in So it's imperative to understand when developing not just this strategy but any strategies to determine both confluence and reference points and the importance as to why we want these confluence type plays where we have multiple reference points. So with that in mind, let's talk about a confluence play which is strategy four. So how it works, very simply. What we've found is the market opens up, whether it's the E-Mini S&P's overnight session or whether it's the oil's overnight session. What we find is that the market has an initial range inside the previous day's range, but more important, we get an overlap of the previous day's high or previous week's high with the current day's high.

We're looking for an initial range to be overlapping or to have an overlapping confluence reference point with the previous day or even, as in this example provided, the previous week or even month. So when you see this trade strategy, the preconditions are very, very easy to determine. we are looking for momentum upon the break of that reference point. We expect to see the following on the break. We want to see one volume, we want to see two volatility, we want to see three momentum plus initiative.

So how we would look to execute this trade is very simple. We are looking for short side trades below the key confluence point. Now, once the market takes out that initial balance, as it does in this example, we are looking for aggressive entry short-side trades. Why? Because every other, there will be a lot of other algorithms, day traders, swing traders, and initiative traders doing the same thing.
