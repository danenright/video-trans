Now there's four basic ways in which a value area can be placed relative to the previous day. I'm going to show them to you in a sense from a low level of conviction to a high level of conviction. By conviction I mean sort of initiative or bias being shown or strong early clues being shown from the market. So the first is when today's value area is contained or opens or trades within the This is the least amount of conviction. Why? Because sellers and buyers are agreeing to the same set of prices that they agreed to on the previous day. The second example is where we have a little bit of overlap or a percentage of overlap between today's value and the previous day's value error. Remember this is still in balanced market so it's not the highest level of conviction but it's slightly more convicted than a complete The next level is where the market or the value error is trading completely above or below the previous day's value error. Note this is when a market is slightly out of balance. Also note when a market is out of balance, this brings more opportunity or a different kind of opportunity than say a market that is completely in balance. And lastly, our most convicted is when a market is completely out of balance and out of, you know, sort of synchronization where we have a completely engulfing value error. So an outside day or an engulfing type day where the current day's value completely engulfs the previous day's value error. This shows us quite a bit of conviction and initiation from either the buyers and Let's now take a look at the examples and I'm going to show them to you on the chart and how they look so you get a better understanding of how they look and what they can mean for your trading strategies.", "transcript": "So we're going to discuss now the value area placement today relative to the previous day.
