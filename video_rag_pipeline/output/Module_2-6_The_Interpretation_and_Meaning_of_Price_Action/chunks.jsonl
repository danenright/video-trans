What is price action? Well, for me, I have a specific definition for price action. It's what we use on all of our trading floors across the world. And it's the personality of the market's level of exchange. So what is that personality? And to me, that personality is how aggressive, how quickly are the orders going through the order book? 20 orders per second, 100 orders per second, and it's your eyes ability over time to really work out that level of intent, that level of acceleration. As you're watching your ladder during this introductory module, and your ladder should all be loaded up on your screen, is seeing the orders going through the order book, when the orders go white to green to red on the cumulative orders that are going through, is how quickly are they going through, and and how the orders when the orders are going through the through the markets how the actual orders the static orders that are consistently changing how they interacting with what's being traded in the market and and and how's their personality altering and although this seems rather the description is is At this time seems perhaps for some of you a little bit confusing as we go through all the examples and the the real trading examples you'll quickly be able to see the new patterns that really emanate from the speed and the Acceleration and and and how like how we like to describe it the actual personality of the markets And really, from the personality, a whole bunch of price action patterns start coming out of the market. So if the market is going through, if the exchange on the order book is going through rather aggressively, well then at a key technical level, well then you're going to have a particular type of order flow pattern that you want to execute, a particular And then what are the recurring events that have associated trading strategies to profit from? So, you know, as you consistently watch the ladder day in day out and watching the price personality and how fast the orders are going through the order book or how slow they're going through the order book, then what will emanate from the marketplace are different types of order book events. And an order book event or a price ladder pattern is just a recurring pattern that you having the ability to execute a certain type of trading strategy in order to profit from and really so it's order flow so the order flow the order flow how we describe order flow is what's being exchanged on the book so whilst you look at your ladder now and when you see that white box accumulating or you see that green box", "transcript": "Okay, the interpretation and meaning of a price action.

And that is the order flow. That is the order flow, really the real crux of the marketplace. Do the orders on the red column and the blue column, so the bids and the ask. What are they doing? Are they at the current trade of price? Are they disappearing or are they remaining static and building up? And how are they actually interacting with the trades that are going through the market? And this is critical level 2 data that you're looking at. price ladder patterns are really spawned so you can interact engage with and trade to profit from and and and really a similar type of concept and the same interpretation is is what you call order book events and an order book event is given that the order book is really thinned out and prior to key data point you know that the moment the order book has has become thin so it's The buyers and the sellers are 300 lots at each price, the average lot size on each price is 300 lots, 300 lots, 300 lots whilst you're looking at your ladder here and all of a sudden they go down to 20 lots, 20 lots, 20 lots prior to an event. You know that that event is a key market event that the market is looking at simply because the market is reducing its risk and people are taking risk off the table and That therefore can create a volatile order book event because you've observed that pattern in the past.

When the when the market has a lot of activity when that when the volume is good The trade of volume is going through the market very aggressively very fast Well, then in those types of conditions you're more prone to potential breakout trades Or it's easier to see absorption plays and these these words that I'm using now You won't understand them now, but there'll be a lot more clearer when we go to those specific sections of the course but the The picture I'm trying to paint here is that there's an entire personality to what you see what's going on in the price ladder and the level of intent can therefore really help you put forth a really strong trading strategy and trading plan to profit from the personality", "transcript": "order to profit from and really so it's order flow so the order flow the order flow how we describe order flow is what's being exchanged on the book so whilst you look at your ladder now and when you see that white box accumulating or you see that green box When that green box appears, the red box, how quickly is it doing?
