This is all about breakout trading now. This is a fantastic example from the WTI well on the 1st of December. We are using a rotational, you know, point and figure rotation. He has the setting on the footprint which is best for breakout trades or at least momentum trades. Now the first thing before we get stuck in is, you know, the whole principle of breakout trading, we really buckled down and identified what it is that creates a breakout trade, why it is that so many traders struggle with breakout trading and struggle to really find some form of consistency and it all came down to timing and we spent a lot of time developing what are the timing elements we can view to see those sorts Don't forget, like I said, everyone can see a breakout. It's pretty obvious. As you're going to see in this example, above these 95s are pretty key area on the charts. The real art is in learning when the timing is right. for the breakout. Now I'm just going to push pause here and go over one or two things that we can see at hand. So we can see the market's kind of gone into a little bit of an accumulation distribution phase ahead of the break. Now the key is within that accumulation and distribution phase is to be aware when that break could potentially come. The real, real standout factor, we obviously do mention a number of factors that we can observe before the break, but in this example, the real standout factor is pretty much the sudden shift in the volume and volatility, so... In the previous rotation we can really see how the market came down. Again it got rejected at these lower prices. We can see it came all the way down to the 78s, traded 46 contracts and went straight back but up. But on the way down, note the dark blues. Some real chunky absorption took place at these higher prices. Now yes, we can argue there was quite a bit of absorption in that previous rotation looking for longs in that previous rotation. That is fair enough. However, that being said, there's one key little subtle clue. When we have this absorption ahead of the break, close to the extreme point as possible. That's the real key. Obviously this absorption does signify that buyers are willing to be buying higher and higher but we really really want to see that absorption coming in around the high. So that's what we're going to pay attention to as well as obviously the shift in the volume and price dynamics.

Okay, let's just move this on a little bit further towards the break. Okay, so again, note what's happening here, okay, we can see quite a bit of sell-side absorption coming into the market, you know, 520 lots traded, at the same time we've got 400 lifted, so, you know, we're starting to see, again, just a shift in dynamic, there's a little bit of a change up in how the buyers and sellers are ultimately Again, we can see the market went up, it tested those 94s and remember what we said, at present we can see 0x31 there was reluctance to lift, 0x79 reluctance to lift through that price, 0x18 reluctance and bang.

I'm not going to make it sound as though it was slow, but watch what happens the Okay, so just before it, notice how we're lifting 183, 183, straight away the market goes bang on, 207 trades, and straight away we see stopouts. And the moment that 180 lock got lifted at 94s, we saw the market stop up. So it was a very, very subtle clue, but very quick, probably not the easiest clue to get on. Again, there had to be an element of preemptive strike, but we did talk about sometimes you do have to preempt when the necessary reward is there, and it's going to pay you for that preemptive strike. Okay, so that was the real subtle clue. We obviously got that real absorption before we rotated back to the high. We then got that last little bit of it. We got again some more absorption at the higher prices before that. One last lift. We saw the commitment at 94s before the market then stopped up.

Obviously, in terms of the breakout, we're looking for a pullback point. Like in the initiative drive, there's no exact pullback point, there's a number of things we can look at. Obviously, we can look for previous key absorption points, maybe around the 10s, 11s, or maybe even the 12s with some really good absorption there. We can look for a fill of maybe an imbalance, or we can look for maybe a key previous swing high low. us an idea of where we can enter. In this example, again, notice the dark shading. I think that was the real clue here. We're seeing not only some very aggressive selling being filled, in other words buyers are happily reloading, but the buyers are also buying at the same time.
