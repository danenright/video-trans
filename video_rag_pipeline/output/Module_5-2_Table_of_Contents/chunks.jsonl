We are just going to briefly touch upon on it in this module because the whole objective of the course is observing the various price added patterns but we cover it but if you want to investigate any further then I do give you a couple of links to go have a look and then you can really explore the landscape all the different types of strategies and systems that do exist in the financial market landscape in the future space. So slide three we focus on HFT strategies. Slide four we look at a graphical depiction of the marketplace and really when you use these graphical models makes you understand a little bit clearer of where our place is in the entire ecosystem. Slide five we look at execution strategy patterns. Slide six we effectively define an What are the objectives of algorithms and HFT strategies slide 8 we look at the objective of discretionary traders as slide 9 And sorry slide 8 the objective discretionary traders within the world of the other mocked participants and what we're trying to do When we observe these other execution strategies slide 9 we Quickly look at a platform to develop your HFTN algorithms for those of you who are interested. It's not the purpose of this course, but for any of you who are interested to really broaden your understanding of this space in algorithms and high frequency training systems, we show you a platform. Slide 10, we talk about further reading that you can really explore. if you want to expand your horizon in the space of algorithms and high frequency trading.", "transcript": "Okay, we'll look at the content roadmap for the rest of this module and do remember we are looking at the Participants and I want you to understand from the outset.
