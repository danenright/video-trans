Now there are two main states of the market. Firstly, the congested state typically occurs when a market is dormant and is characterised by the following. Markets are in congested zones for 70% of the time. Just so you know, most of the time markets are really caught up in a range, and that's another name for congested periods, they are caught up in a range and really locked in a tight period where they're oscillating in value. Another expression that you can use and if you participate in the market profile understand value trading, you really start understanding when the market shifts from one value to another value through the price discovery mechanism. They're also defined by narrow ranges as we've mentioned low volume. So the activity within that range It's a really slow and lethargic and the best types of price action plays that you play in those Type of a lot of range bound trading or there's you'll get the flippers in the market You'll get a lot of a false little breaks or false little moves a lot of You know prices that blip around and the type of activity where you just engage in more scalping Activity as the auctioning activity is very very low now. There's also defined by low liquidity So the order book there's not much going through on the order book Uh, you know a lot of the prices are are not really genuine either And as we mentioned, this is range-bound activity, and there is also lots of passive activity. So these are really the main characteristics of a congested market, just before it starts moving out of congestion into a new breakout zone. And you'll observe if you watch your ladder thousands and thousands of hours, you'll start noticing the little subtleties in the price personality change when it shifts. Just before it shifts from congestion to expansion or through that new momentum phase as it goes into price discovery mode, you'll notice that as little subtleties, a little bit of volume coming into the market, a little bit of a change of different types of auctioning activity and speed on the ladder. And if you're already clued in and dialed into your ladder, you'll be able to pick up those clues quickly enough in order to execute with effective size just before the breakout occurs. So you always have to keep very observant in those very quiet periods. as those quiet periods really mature, and in each of your individual markets, you'll start really determining of how long a maturity period is. If a market's been maturing in the hourly charts for five hours in a 15 tick range on your bond market or. Your euro currency or in gold and you've noticed that that congestion is is longer than the average on of your observations and trusting your own Understand and trusting your own analysis of the market when the market is becoming really mature in its range then knowing when it's the right time to start keeping an eye when that market starts changing its little personality just before shifts because", "transcript": "Okay, so what is momentum play?

So really very important. And also you know when it's in a range and the congestion, another characteristic is the reduced open interest. So you know positions are being closed out, squared out, and there's not many and the open interest only starts increasing again once the market seeks out of its range and seeks out of its value. So just like the to states of high energy and activity. So, knowing what strategies to deploy in the calm states and what strategy to deploy when the market is highly energetic, highly active. And how do you define highly energetic, and we've spoken this in the past, and highly active is when the auctioning activity is high, when the amount of trades that are going through the market are high. And when that is happening, the market will keep on auctioning in the direction until it loses its velocity, until people don't want to participate in the auctioning activity. and then the market rolls back again or rolls back up again once it's auctioned too far towards the downside.
