So definitely something we'd be paying attention to, very unusual to see. If we look at that candlestick chart for instance, we can see really a little bit of a flag forming here, where we've had the bit of initiative. We can see that initiative on the left side. two and three loads that are starting to condense now. We're getting to that point now where we're looking for a continuation pattern. Now what's lovely about this example is it does come after we have done the drill session as well as the unit session on the accumulation and distribution. Now what's very different in this sense and what we can see is that the volumes here are by no means high. So in the accumulation phase we were talking about having really dark colors at the extreme points. isn't really an accumulation distribution, this is very much consolidation. And we can say that with a great degree of confidence for two factors, one relatively low volume within the distribution, but also two, a lack of shift in the delta, and three, a real lack of absorption taking place on any of the extremes. So this is more of a consolidation phase that we're actually seeing. I'm just going to pause that a little bit. So what we've seen now, obviously, we've got a potential continuation of this little flag that's formed. Now, definitely we'd want to be aware of this break and the potential for continuation for two reasons. Number one, obviously, the very positive delta on the day does show the potential for unwind if this does begin to initiate toward the downside. And then obviously too, we are in a little bit of a flag structure, so by that definition we should see a little bit of continuation. Now when we went through obviously the unit, we did speak a lot about the principles underlying the unit. One of the key principles is defining a break and what a break should look like. So let's go through that now. The first thing is note, we have taken out that low, so we have broken out of this recent range. Do note the key standout obviously. We are seeing the initiative, so we got quite a bit of imbalance occurring on that breakdown", "transcript": "welcome back to the drill session this is a strategy 3 drill session failed a break of support and resistance now before we get into the drill and get to that point of execution of this drill let's just paint the context what we can see on the delta very unusual actually so we've got a 5000 delta this is obviously the WTI oil So we've got a very very high Delta, yet prices are in the lower region of the day.

We can see the volume picking up which again adds to the fact that it is a decent break. We can also see the delta moving in the direction of the break and as well as a So we can see for all intents and purposes this is a genuine break. Let's roll the tape then now. What we shouldn't be seeing in a break, and this is the real key to understanding your market. This market has broken that previous low at 0.01 by 4 prices, 5 prices. So what you should not be seeing on a breakout is you should not be seeing someone taking the other side of the trade. So to see these really, really dark colors just as we've had the break, that is a It's a real anomaly, that is definitely not what you should be seeing on a breakout. We've gotten someone that's just stood in the way of that break, absorbed as much as he could. You know, we can see real dark colors, not another one of the segments anywhere on this page is that color, so it really stands out. inside of the previous range. So really, really key failed break here. The markets come down. We're looking for an entry point around that previous low, 0.01, 0.02. Now note, obviously, really good failed breaks. We don't always get the price we want. So we can see markets come down. It's retesting the three. It's a little bit of absorption, but it's not At this point, if we're not filled O2s, we're going to have to be more aggressive. Look for a fill around the O3s and O4s. Okay, do bear in mind, obviously, because of the nature of the strategy, because of the failed break, because we've seen now shorts sucked into that extreme, there's a lot of badly positioned, shorter time frame participants, whether that's speculative or algorithm in nature, either way, the dynamic for both of those participants is the same, which is once we get to a certain price point, they're going to be very, very reluctant they will execute at market okay that being said obviously once we you know do see the extension of those six we should see this little whatever you want to call a little bit of a lack of punch through their real low volume middle area that was formed in the consolidation zone now in terms of targets of this trade what we're looking for is a test of the other side of the distribution so we're looking for a move up towards these", "transcript": "So let's go through that now.

So again, the important thing is to assess the context of your market. What I would say is if we had, for example, let's say we had a very negative delta on the day, our target would probably be a lot higher. Why? Because we've obviously got a lot more shorts in the market that can potentially unwind, potential. So it's all about context when it comes to your target. Most important obviously we want to manage risk as we begin the process of rotating higher. We can move that stop from below the low slightly higher. Okay, and as we obviously start to move more in our favor, we can rotate the stop in the direction as it goes onside. Okay, so important, I'm just going to fast-forward this a little bit. We get above, obviously that little bit of a, I don't want to call it a ledge, just a little bit of an area that the market is failing to capture. We get above it and we can see the market does then begin the process of extending higher. At this point we can move that stop up maybe towards scratch, maybe towards that 5601, tighten it up. Again, you'll notice with every one of these strategies I'm going to talk to you about tightening that stop, reining in that stop. That's the art of being a very good day trader. You're always thinking about managing risk, always thinking about reducing the potential Okay, and so we can see obviously, as we do rotate higher, just a few things to note in terms of price response. As we came up, okay, notice there was liquidity being provided by the sellers. Okay, these are secondary sellers. Once we get above those secondary sellers, i.e. above those 06s, we can see now that the buyers are actually starting to sit on the bid and reload the bid. Okay, so we've switched there from having sellers providing liquidity to now buyers really looking for that liquidity at best price possible. Okay, and this then continues and drifts higher for the remainder of the session video. a strong amount of absorption. If we didn't manage to get in lower down, we really are getting a very strong signal of bi-side absorption, quite aggressive, and that's obviously again sending us a signal that we should be long looking for the brake higher.
