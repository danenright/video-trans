We could also then have a second tail where the market reverses and instantly moves in the opposite direction. Now the volatility and the difference between the two is vitally important. Obviously in the second example, this is a far stronger rejection that we are seeing Don't forget, a tail is effectively representing a strong response from the other time frame participants. So in this example, let's say the market moves lower and suddenly we get this move back higher. we could be seeing either initiative from the buyers or equally response from the buyers. And depending how the market reverses will dictate to us how strong a response we are seeing occurring in the market. Now, another important thing to focus on is that the tail effectively essentially becomes a key reference point. Now, why? Well, very simply, if a market leaves a tail, and we're seeing, say, in this example, a strong response. from the buyers, that strong response should effectively be an important reference point the next time we visit it. In other words, if we revisit it again and then look to take lower, it means that there are buyers that now need to exit those positions. Just bear that in mind. You know, tails do represent very key important reference points. And lastly, don't forget, we get two types of tails. but we also then get the tail that is not hidden, so we can just write there, not. Now, bear in mind, a hidden tail is just where we do not get a single set of TPO, a not hidden tail is where we get a single set of TPO's, whereas a hidden tail would sometimes, it might look a little bit like this, so if we got our initial move up, the market opens at this price, but closes at this price, and the next letter we open at the high, and the market closes back down below. Now again, whilst that on say a traditional volume profile would look like a double top or would look like the market's kind of, there's no tail, in essence there is because the market has instantly reversed after retesting the one extreme. Okay, so let's now move into the example we've got. Let's just keep in mind the context. So what you'll see is that we were sitting inside the previous day's value area.

Now let's watch the recording and see how the market plays out over the course of So we can see in very early trade, the market is just sitting within the previous day's value, nothing much going on. Now what we want to look for, the characteristics of a tail is a shift and a change in the volatility. So we'll see a very, very big dynamic shift between how the buyers and sellers respond. at higher prices. So if by that definition if prices are representing a huge discount we should see price reverse quite quickly and likewise if price is representing a huge premium we should see prices reverse equally as quickly. So what we can see in the early part of this example is that the market is merely distributing. It's well within the previous day's value area. It's a well balanced open. We can see there's nothing really going on, no real opportunity as we remain firmly in balance. The important thing to understand is what occurs once the market breaks away from this area that it's accepted for almost one and a half. session. So let's watch the price response now as we move above this $164.70. Let's see if the dynamic changes somewhat. Now remember, the important thing to remember with the strategy in terms of execution, you don't have to preempt, you don't have to preempt a tail, the profile will show you the tail. When it shows you the tail, you then want to execute based on the manner I'm going Just remember, you don't have to rush in terms of this, it'll be quite obvious when there's either a tail or a hidden tail. With that in mind, just remember guys, the major difference between a hidden and a not hidden tail is when a tail is hidden, a lot of the time you will get very well rewarded for spotting it. Because it's not as obvious as a tail that's not hidden, you won't always see the tail pick it up and observe it quite early, you do get rewarded quite nicely for that.

We can't see larger set of TPO's, nothing really significant occurring at this point So let's move this on a little bit and see if we can catch up to the point where we suddenly see a little bit of volatility coming into the market.

So we can see the largest half-hour TPO of the day, almost double the range of any one of these other sets of TPO's that we've had over the course of the day. So a real surge in volume and volatility has come into the market. And this is key when trading tails. You need to see that surge in volume and volatility. The most effective tails are created on a pick-up in the volume and volatility. So it's important to understand, The better ones tend to come with a surge in volume and volatility. Now note, we popped up to the highs of 164.98 and very quickly, notice within the same Y print, let's watch where this TPO closes.

So we can see that tail now poking out there, and the minute that next TPO opens, let's pause that for a sec. So the minute that next TPO opens and we close back inside the value area, that is our clue that something has occurred.

If, however, as in this example, we get a very aggressive move and instantly we get the very aggressive response, we are going to need to be far more aggressive. You're almost going to have to be a little bit preemptive in the tail. You can only be preemptive by really, really watching that price ladder closely. This is one of those trade strategies that it's a premium to be able to read the price ladder.
