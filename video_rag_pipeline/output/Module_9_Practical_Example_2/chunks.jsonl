So let's commence looking. at this mark now. Now what we'll be watching is this 45 to 47 area and you can already see in a rather anomaly area of absorption being the 46 to 45 where there's approximately 9,000 contracts that have been traded over here and let me just bring this to your attention so let's take a draw and so what we're looking at is right over here this So, as you can see, there's 44, 45, 46, but namely there's 40. 5 and 46 region so that's where we're keeping a very very close eye on as we watch the absorption. Now do remember what's very important when you are watching an absorption area is to know the general momentum and the velocity of your market and how fast the exchange does happen at per price and also knowing when there's an anomaly area of exchange and when you observe puts a break in the market and when you see that break well then what type of trading strategy are you going to deploy in order to effectively execute.

So we've got been absorbed the the 46 You can see the activity has started to slow down as the buyers now Start really moving upwards along the price that has started moving up the page and you can see look how ops obvious this is. We have almost 15,000 contracts trading at 46ers and 45s. So a clear iceberg, a clear potential volume slice order, not a potential time slice order but a volume slice in an iceberg and so the trading strategy is you join the iceberg that you observe or if you are short you start exiting your position. So ready, very key. to understand where you observe an iceberg at a high or a low of a day, and it helps you manage your position a lot more effectively. So what we're gonna do now, we're shifting our observation to the Euro stocks You can see just gone short here on the Euro stocks It's gonna be another pattern that we're gonna be trading an absorption pattern at the high of day in the Euro stocks now Yeah, here is what we're looking at. So let's look so in the Euro stocks We're looking at absorption at the high of day Remember, you always know what an absorption at the high of day or the low of day is when you understand your market intrinsically well. And so, you know, in the oil market it might be a couple, you know, a 300 lot and a 400 lot being distributed at the high of day. In the Euro stocks it's between 7,000 to 10,000 lots. So through your observations, through your journalizing, as you watch your markets day in, day out, you start getting to understand the specific personality of your market. And once you start understanding the specific personality of your market, And given the speed that the market is auctioning the orders and the orders that are being traded on the book, you're able to execute a lot more confidently because you understand your market's personality. So what we're looking for here again is an iceberg partner. We're looking for an iceberg part in distribution. The market environment is high volume, moving to low auctioning activity. So what I mean by that is, firstly, there's a lot of intense volume that's going through.

So we're looking at the 89s, and you can see, okay, we still get reoffered at the 89s, gets reoffered, the iceberg is there. 10,000 lots being charged at the 89s. and keeps on changing but all of a sudden what is happening that the bids are one lot, five lot on the bid, one lot again, really struggling and the offers are a little bit stronger.

He he reoffers now all of a sudden the 88s have disappeared So now look at the 88s have stepped, you know back in but he's not taking much of 89 89 is still standing firm now. We've just had it gone quickly bit over There's still some size here, the trader is still holding onto his 89s. The risk on this trade will potentially be at the 92s, you know, 1, 2, 3 ticks, might be able to get a short, but again the 89s holds firm. We've now had... 20,000 contracts traded at 88, we've had 13,000 contracts traded at 89 and 6,000 contracts traded at 90. I mean a significant amount of volume trading up here and there's going to be a pinch point and so is the ability to collect where the pinch point where the buyers will start feeling the pain. potentially start covering back towards this low volume load. So again 89s and 90s keep on holding and as you see as this video continues You'll slowly start seeing the velocity and volume on the ladder Really starting to slow down and as I start slowing down and start suggesting that the seller is starting to win at this Battle and we're we're still watching 89 still holding 88 keeps on so this is battle between 88 and 89 But because the velocity is slowing down. It's starting to really You know for the first time now the 88s are trying to hold the offer you see now the 88s are coming in holding the offer, a lot more companies there, 87s have been taken out now, so the 88s, 87s, now are we going to get a little bit more pain towards the downside, are 86 going to be taken, I'm doing almost a horse commentary for you right here, but we can start seeing that the 86s have been taken out, the 85s have been taken out and as the market slowly towards the 82s and the trader actually exited 85s, but subsequently this market did start moving towards this low volume and node. So that's a really two key illustrations of absorption plays. One in the euro stocks at the high of day, one in the bund at the low of day. You can see at the bund now has moved up towards the 52.

We've just had it gone quickly bit over There's still some size here, the trader is still holding onto his 89s. The risk on this trade will potentially be at the 92s, you know, 1, 2, 3 ticks, might be able to get a short, but again the 89s holds firm. We've now had... 20,000 contracts traded at 88, we've had 13,000 contracts traded at 89 and 6,000 contracts traded at 90. I mean a significant amount of volume trading up here and there's going to be a pinch point and so is the ability to collect where the pinch point where the buyers will start feeling the pain. potentially start covering back towards this low volume load. So again 89s and 90s keep on holding and as you see as this video continues You'll slowly start seeing the velocity and volume on the ladder Really starting to slow down and as I start slowing down and start suggesting that the seller is starting to win at this Battle and we're we're still watching 89 still holding 88 keeps on so this is battle between 88 and 89 But because the velocity is slowing down. It's starting to really You know for the first time now the 88s are trying to hold the offer you see now the 88s are coming in holding the offer, a lot more companies there, 87s have been taken out now, so the 88s, 87s, now are we going to get a little bit more pain towards the downside, are 86 going to be taken, I'm doing almost a horse commentary for you right here, but we can start seeing that the 86s have been taken out, the 85s have been taken out and as the market slowly towards the 82s and the trader actually exited 85s, but subsequently this market did start moving towards this low volume and node. So that's a really two key illustrations of absorption plays. One in the euro stocks at the high of day, one in the bund at the low of day. You can see at the bund now has moved up towards the 52. So really two really beautiful absorption plays and how to sculpt and trade around them and how to potentially build a core position and this is really important on how to position on potential volume slice orders on iceberg partner plays.", "ocr_text": null, "visual_caption": null, "metadata": {"chunk_idx": 5, "frame_refs": ["output/Module_9_Practical_Example_2/frames/scene_0004_end.jpg", "output/Module_9_Practical_Example_2/frames/scene_0005_start.jpg", "output/Module_9_Practical_Example_2/frames/scene_0005_mid.jpg"]}}
