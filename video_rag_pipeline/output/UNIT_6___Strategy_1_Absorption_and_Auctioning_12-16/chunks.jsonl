We want to see some sort of absorption type auctioning price response. Now in terms of the balanced imbalance markets, again what we want to see is we can see the strategy in both, however we note that it will likely be more aggressive in imbalance markets. What you would typically do here is you would get your strategy Whether it was, you know, you get the absorption auctioning strategy and you would determine was it in a balanced situation Or was it in an imbalanced situation and you will then go and fill it out accordingly Okay. Now obviously in terms of trade location, you know in terms of market context We do tend to see the strategy work better at extremes. Okay.

Okay obviously do bear in mind we do get the absorption auctioning occurring mid-range sometimes however by the very nature of it being mid-ranged the market tends to be quite well balanced. Therefore, it's imperative to note the volumes trading through as you could well be observing a consolidation period rather than absorption and auctioning, so just bear that in mind. Alright, then in terms of market conditioning, obviously we've got our various time frame participants. We're in the market note. We do have the three, you know, obviously we've summarized it in three time frame participants a large influential time frame participants as well as algorithmic and speculative in nature the major difference large influential can Obviously influence price create initiative and hold directional moves. Whereas speculative and you know algorithmic by the given the rules that they do trade by and obviously the strategies they employ ultimately they tend to not hold on to positions as long and they're far quicker to unwind those positions as well so do just always make sure you're referencing which time frame participants Note, we spoke about the different types of liquidity within both the accumulation and distribution zone. Obviously, within the accumulation zone, you're going to see large pockets of liquidity at the extremes, large selling being absorbed at the lows, large buying being absorbed just before the break and obviously note once we do get the break the liquidity or the nature of the liquidity does shift from you know being provided at the extremes within the auction zone to suddenly then kind of disappearing and the market looking to navigate toward the next And again do note we spoke in terms of volatility. We said volatility does not equal trend Volatility is simply a greater variance around the mean so a greater number of prices being traded over in the same Time period and obviously we said that volatility will be relatively low within Between the two pivots once we break out of those pivots.

Now what you're going to see as we go through a lot of these strategies is that market context is imperative a lot of the time to the potential reward. You're going to see me refer quite often to you know having you know very very rarely or any of these strategies going to have an exact target okay. Trading is not it's not that straightforward all right we're not algorithms Upon whatever context the markets in so what I mean by that for example. Let's say obviously markets are trending and We're playing a breakout right now The potential for award in a trending market with breaking out is much higher than say a market. That's very well balanced That's simply just moving sideways. Okay, so a breakout in a balanced market versus a breakout in a market That's trending you're gonna get very different outcomes and your award structures are gonna be very different what is the market context. So you can develop an understanding of what is the best context in which the strategies are working for you. Now, once we've obviously identified that context, we're going to move on to obviously identifying the strategy. So what are the key observations that say to us, bang, that strategy is in play? What was it that you could outline and draw from the market that said this strategy was in play at this point in time? Now, You're gonna hear me talk quite a lot throughout the next couple of strategies over the next couple of slides You're gonna hear me talk not slide. Sorry the next couple of strategies over the next couple of units You're gonna hear me talk a lot about You know clues and and what is the the timing clue and what was the signal that bang? There was your opportunity to get in with limited risk and maximum reward and that's pretty much what you want to be identifying Yes, what are those? Identifications that you can draw that make the strategy in play Okay, so the first, obviously, we talk about is the interaction.

So we spoke a lot about this principle in unit three. We touched upon it again in this unit session, and we're going to touch upon this for the next nine-unit session. Do note, obviously, whilst we're inside those two pivots, we noted the responsive behavior. So we saw the dark, you know, sort of delta patches at the extremes of the pivots. That was ultimately the responsive, you know, price response. And then once we get the breakout of those pivots, that is the initiative break. Okay. Then obviously in terms of, you know, is the interaction passive or aggressive? It's initially quite passive passive why because market rotates between the two pivots and there's just passive interaction taking place Eventually that shifts on the break and it turns to a more aggressive price response Down in the box below, obviously, if there's any kind of variations you want to talk about, any kind of key points that really reflected time to enter, etc., that's where you want to include. So in this box, what I would like to include and what I want you guys to think about is what was the key observation you took away in terms of interaction that gave you Okay now we spoke about absorption just before the break so for instance obviously to the break to the upside we spoke about how before the break we were seeing a large selling absorption at the high and last large buying absorption at the low. Just before the breakout of the high we suddenly saw instead of seeing large selling absorption we actually saw large buying absorption at the high and that's what you're going to write in that box. What was the interaction that gave you that clue? okay because again by writing this down every single time you're going to learn to develop pattern recognition ultimately okay now metrics super important you want to pay attention to these key metrics again you simply get the chart up go and have a look at the volume look at the time look at the delta the cumulative delta the relative change make sure you're writing down what was happening with every one of these metrics within this strategy Okay, so in general what we what we observed was high volume within the distribution but much higher on the break.

In other words, how should the buyers and sellers interact based on my analysis? How should based on my analysis. Now, what makes this so brilliant is that you're observing fact-based information. So you're taking the facts from the market to develop your patterns. Now, when those facts repeat themselves, guess what? The pattern's gonna repeat itself. And that's what we're after. We're after an objective, fact-based approach to trading strategies. Okay, let's now move then onto the last part of the template, which is the execution methodology.

But you don't want to allow, you know yourself to become greedy, to become too specific in target taking that you're ultimately Start seeing your winners evaporate Okay, in terms of leveraging, we're going to talk a lot about this. This is just simply, can you get big? How can you get big? Can you put on some size? Where can you put on some size? Where can you get big? We will discuss leveraging a lot later on in one of the units and why it's so important. But for now, just know within the strategy, we're not interested in leveraging. Why? Excuse the risk reward.

Okay we finished every one of these observations or sorry every one of these template completions with the tip okay again these are my tips they could be your tips it's up to you. So the tip for the strategy obviously usually a calm before the initiative is taken we spoke about that I showed you what that looks like it's a little bit of absorption just before Okay what you would then do this is not the end of the template obviously there's two more sections the template one is the accountability section you write down how long it took how long did it take you to complete this template reason being obviously you'll get better you'll get quicker it's also a way to motivate yourself to see it actually doesn't take that long and you're gaining quite a lot from the experience also don't forget to sign off on it Equally don't forget to fill out which day it is that you're completing this on simply so you can follow yourself building a habit Okay Building habits. The first thing you need to believe is that it can be done within a very short space of time And that's why we have that day count at the bottom of the template Lastly read the quote keep reading that quote keep reminding yourself Why it is you filling out this template and remember you are on a path to sustainable pattern recognition Let's move on then to the following slide So like I mentioned earlier on in the, um... the unit every one of the trade strategies is going to include an additional reading and for very good reason These are books that you know often I get people asking me.

Now the first book we're going to recommend or I'm going to recommend is Ray Dalio's new book Principles. Okay this was released I think in October November 2017 so it's just come out. A little bit about Ray Dalio. Most of you should have heard of him and he is effectively the founder of Bridgewater and it is one of the largest if not the largest hedge funds in the world. So There has been a number of videos you can go watch on YouTube But you can go watch you can also go read one of these documents about principles And Ray Dalio deals with all these concepts of doing things differently trying new things to ultimately get the most effective Outcomes now this book is no different in terms of a summary. It's a real practical application book. Hence I'm recommending it in terms of the action. It's going to want it's going to provoke your thought for for definite But it's also going to make you want to start to implement actionable processes and that's why I'm really excited to introduce this book to you. Now some of the key highlights, I don't want to spoil it too much, but there is a five step process for getting what you want out of life from this book, becoming open-minded and learning from your failures and weaknesses, a concept we're going to deal with a lot throughout all of these strategies. You're often going to hear me talk about how through me failing at certain strategies Then moving past your ego so that you can focus on the pursuit of your goals as well as why having people around you is important for increasing probabilities and lastly the idea of Mito meritocracy and the best ideas through disagreement and this is a fascinating concept because what it ultimately says is that through disagreement, you know, the whole idea of brainstorming effectively is not as effective as people think, but rather disagreeing with people is the best way to ultimately get some of the best ideas. So definitely read this book, put it on your wish list, make sure you get this and read it as soon as you can. All right, let's now finish off and talk about some of the drills for the rest of the unit. Okay, so at the end of every unit, we're going to have a Basically, this is for me to introduce the drill to you, give you an understanding of how to execute the drill, as well as the process thereafter.

The reason is that you're gonna learn a lot more through your mistakes But more importantly also gonna remember those mistakes a lot better rather than going straight to the guided tuition Okay, once you've done that and you've completed the template go and watch it with the guided tuition Compare and adjust your template. Okay, so make the necessary changes. Remember there is no right or wrong Add to your template where maybe you might not have thought of something.

Okay, that's so important before you go on to the narrated Drill session make sure you complete the template yourself. Okay. The reason is that you're gonna learn a lot more through your mistakes But more importantly also gonna remember those mistakes a lot better rather than going straight to the guided tuition Okay, once you've done that and you've completed the template go and watch it with the guided tuition Compare and adjust your template. Okay, so make the necessary changes. Remember there is no right or wrong Add to your template where maybe you might not have thought of something. Then I suggest you go back and watch the full practical examples utilized within the unit and again focus on some of the key principles and focus on obviously the identifiers within each one of the template sections. Okay, again complete a second template. This is for your own good. Lots of practice will get you good at completing this template. And once you've done that and you have confidence in the strategy and in the principles underlying that strategy, move on to the next unit. All right, that now wraps up unit six strategy one and we're going to finish off with the quote which is that success is the sum of small efforts, repeated day in and day out.", "ocr_text": null, "visual_caption": null, "metadata": {"chunk_idx": 11}}
