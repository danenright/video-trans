Now some of those control identifiers are single prints, low volume areas, tails, volatility where we have range expansion, the one-time framing and lastly engulfing TPO's. It's important that you always sort of make a note, as you're trading throughout the day, if you ever see any of these control identifiers.

Now where we begin with this is firstly with the definition of the word wide. What I will say is this is very much a relative term, so what you need to understand about this trade strategy is you need to know what is the average current range Now, there's a number of ways in which you can do this. One, I have a tendency to use just a simple moving average of a desired time within each market. So, for instance, in the Bund, I can tell you what the average range is between 7 and 8 a.m. In the E-Money S&Ps, I can tell you what the average range is from 11 p.m. at night Now, by knowing what the average range is within these time frames, I can see when there is a relatively wide initial range within the market. Now, when I see these initial ranges being particularly wide, there are two types of trade strategies that exist, and they look as follows.

The market attempts the extension with the direction of the short term trend, fails, comes back inside and merely just distributes for the rest of the day within a range.

Now in terms of the trade opportunity, it's important before we show you the trade opportunity to understand why this wide initial balance actually occurs so that you can then understand how you are supposed to take risk on this trade strategy.

It could also be for technical reasons. So the market may open beyond a key technical level and as a result we have a lot of stops being initiated on the open.

So what is the trade strategy? Well, it's simple. As you can see in the example on your right, this is the second of the two. Now, what occurs here is we can see the very wide initial balance early on. Now, note this is roughly 10 handles in the e-mini S&P. On average, at that point, the average wide initial balance, or the average, sorry, initial balance was roughly 5 handles. So we had double the average initial balance in the session.

The minute the market can no longer sustain the break below that entry point, we are Now remember I said to you in these two examples, the one is slightly easier than the other and the reason is very simple. In this example, which is the harder of the two, whilst we still want to take the buy trade, we can see that the relative reward that we're going to receive for being right is relatively skewed to the risk we're going to have to take. What do I mean? Now, in terms of reward, because this market doesn't fully trade the entire distribution, we don't have as much upside as we would like, so the risk-reward is skewed toward a one-to-one type play. Let's have a look at the second example so I can show you when we do have the easier of the two options, why this option gives us far better risk-reward opportunity. As you can see, this is the rotation, so in terms of the execution style, once that market re-enters the range, we're then looking for buy-side trades. Now again, note how this market actually ended up stopping us out, so again, this trade strategy did fail in this example before eventually giving us potential upside.
