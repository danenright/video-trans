So this is again a one week exclusive practice where you'll be provided with a worksheet which we'll talk about just in a bit. We want you to find five flipping and spoofing patterns in the following markets per day in the Bund, the DAX, the 500. Ensure you pick the low liquidity environments that generally either during the lunchtime or the pre-cash open the future session or any other periods that are that are you know, not volatile not excessive But you do sometimes have these flippers and these you know, and these patterns in high volume liquidity conditions, they're not as prevalent, but if you spot them, then know how to trade it. There's no complete doctrine or complete rule book of where they exist. Remember, the markets are dynamic. So just remember, ensure you pick the low liquidity and see if it's possible to observe it in the high volume environment. So if you do observe in the high volume Record your observation and learning using the following worksheet journal template So use additional foundation again the time the type of pattern you've observed how you traded it What was your learning outcome record your trading screens to record it? You know you have to record your trading screens every single day whilst you're developing so you can do the reviewing because when you do the reviewing you are consolidating your learning and you're developing your whole universal pattern inventory or pattern plays and setups in your unconscious state and then when you face it with again you're able to react a little bit quicker every single time you're reacting more and more quicker so really critically important build your contextual understanding on when patterns work best in your in your learning outcomes section and then you start really start developing this and again develop your own pattern aims and belief in your interpretation of the market and upload your top flipping spoofing patterns of how you traded them on the day in the community in the community flipping room and and no longer than two minutes of the video just so that key area of how you the activity in in a quicker way and then upload five videos by the end of the week.
