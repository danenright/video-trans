Now before we move on to the actual trade set up and get going with the set up, let's just discuss what we mean by confluence. Now, the important thing to understand about a reference point is that a reference point is not a level. It's not an area in a market whereby longer-term players or short-term players will initiate. A reference point is the point in the market which we reference in order to execute various positions. in the yield markets or the bond markets and we can see over the course of the year this market keeps respecting, keeps respecting, keeps respecting. So this is a reference point whereby buyers are reluctant to buy higher prices and they back off and therefore sell up and sellers are willing to initiate shorts. Why? Because there's a lack of commitment. So buyers and sellers both reference this point in the market as in a very interesting point Once we take out that reference point, we will then begin to see various different time frame participants being brought into the market, being forced to respond to the change in prices. Now, when we have an overlap of these reference points, we want to pay particular attention. And there's a number of reasons why. A reference point is the point in the market whereby it brings various timeframe participants, whether it's long-term influential timeframe participants, whether it's short-term algorithmic participants. It brings a lot of participants into the market. If we have one or two or three different reference points, we're going to have loads, if not all the different timeframe participants participating at that point in the market. work particularly well because there's a lot of different time frame participants all getting involved. So this is the second of our momentum strategies and let's get into it and we can discuss why. What we spoke about in some of the slides was, we spoke about two different types of confluence plays. Now, there exists many, many different confluence plays. What's important is to understand the concept of confluence. The two we spoke about was, firstly, the initial example we had was actually a weekly confluence play, where we had the E-mini S&Ps on a weekly chart, and we spoke about how almost day one we sat within the previous week's range, but formed a double", "transcript": "Welcome back now to the replay series for the fourth of our 11 unique strategies where we're going to talk about the confluence initial balance breakout.

So that was our first Confluence play or Confluence initial balance breakout play that we spoke about. And the second one we spoke about was the one we're going to discuss here. Now just to paint a little bit of context. We just had a mere normal distribution day and the market formed a low and we then opened up somewhere in around the middle of that range and the initial balance initially double bottomed with the previous day's low. So let's get into the strategy now and have a look how it played out over the course of the day. Trading well inside the previous day's range. We can see that is now our key pivot. Remember we spoke that is our Confluence point in the market so key point there as we can see sorry That's not the confluence point down yet 161 70 that is our confluence point So the M cash print opens up. That's the cash market remember What we said is we're looking for stops below that key confluence point, so we're looking for longer term time frame participants to step into the market. Now as you can see, so the market comes and it breaks that 161.70, trades straight down to 161.35 area, so a nice quick move. Now note in 30 minutes what we did. In 30 minutes we did effectively double the range that we had had on the day. As you can see, quite an aggressive early move. Now, let's just pause this quickly and just assess what actually has occurred. So first and foremost, we said with the confluence play, or again, note, I'm using the initial balance here as my secondary confluence. The important thing to understand is that confluence can be any number of reference points. In the example I'm showing you, I'm leaning on the previous day's low which is that 161.70 as well as obviously the initial balance low. Now the first thing we spoke about is once we see the confluence in clay, we want to then look for momentum type strategies which in this case is looking for short side trades of that initial balance low.", "transcript": "What's important is to understand the concept of confluence.

And note how quickly, within 15 to 20 minutes, we very quickly got paid out on that momentum play. So in terms of the characteristics, what we want to look for is the volume plus the volatility. So we want to see volume and volatility expansion, which is exactly what we've seen More importantly, because it's a momentum type play, time is a very key element with a strategy, all right? It shouldn't take long for the market to tell you whether or not you're wrong or right. Now note, if this is a key point, if we have referenced this confluence area in we should see long time frame participants initiating, short time, we should see a lot of initiation in and around this 161-70 area and it's that initiation which has created the downside opportunity and that is why we're focusing on this play.

Now the second thing to pay attention to is that once we take out that key confluence area that we've spoken about, there are naturally going to be short term shorts in the market. So they are currently short or the positioning of the market is net short below that 161.70. So that's important to understanding this confluence play because what we should in Either the market continues once it breaks the key reference point and continues to trend lower over the period of the day, or we come back to that key reference point, take out the natural positioning in the market and go in the opposite direction. So there's our two plays, guys. First and foremost, we're looking for the short on the break of the reference point. However, if we continue to hold that confluence area, the market should continue with the short term trend. If it does not, that key break becomes a very important area because of the short positioning, in this example that we've just seen.

Now note, if this is the area where shorts were shorting below, it's the same area that we should see long initiating longs now. once this market comes back above is we should be looking to initiate longs above that 160, 170. And as we can see with the N print and then the P print and the Q print, we can see the unwind of that short positioning and we can see how aggressively, again, notice how the pick up in volatility occurs as prices are moving higher. Why? Because we're seeing shorts having to pay up at higher and higher prices. Note, once all those shorts are out the market and the positioning returns to more neutral, we should start to see that market flatten out a little bit and begin to distribute for the remainder of the day. So it's very simple. We're looking for shorts initially on the break of the reference point. If we cannot hold that level, we're looking for an unwind of that positioning as the If we get a retest of that area where the short's unwound, that should now hold as initial support. Why? Because resistance turns to support. So let's see how this plays out now for the rest of the day. Note, those are the two key sort of trade setups or trade shows we're looking for in and around that confluence point, and then as well as support and turning to, or resistance turning to support. So that would have been our resistance, that would have been our support. Now note how the market is actually, over the latter end of the day, or the latter end of the session, starting to form a little bit of a distribution higher. So what we can see here is that very easily that someone, very aggressively, whilst we got the initiative very early on, there were some longer time frame participants that really wanted that market, that bought up that market quite quickly and quite aggressively. Notice how the V-print comes in and around, down towards that 161.70. So let's just fast forward this a little bit, see how it plays out at the end of the day, and then we can hopefully wrap up our fourth in our series of strategies.
