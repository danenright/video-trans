So what we're going to talk about in module 2 is we're going to start off by talking about the types of auction rotations, weak and strong control factors that you see within the various auctions. We're then going to turn our attention to the volume point of control, talk a off with the brief introduction of high and low volume areas. Now, before we move on to part seven, I really want to just take a moment to sort of go back over the quote we just saw from George Soros. I think it's quite pertinent to traders and not just trading, but what George Soros was saying was that he's progressed and he's been successful I just want to share with you when I was growing as a trader, at one point I think after two years in my career, I stopped and I looked at a lot of the strategies I had developed and I very quickly realized that the strategies I had developed were based on the mistakes I made so early on in my career. So for instance, I used to be someone that would sit there and I would have these Time and time and time again I would lose so much money fading trend days. All of a sudden I developed a strategy of how to trade a trend day, how to recognize initiative price response and how to take advantage of trend days. Merely recognizing my mistake of losing money on trend days helped me to formulate the Ultimately, by recognising the mistake, I became successful and was finally able to not lose money from trading, from fading trend days, but rather make money from going with the momentum on trend day. It's so pertinent that you understand that quote as you will again, you know, whether you're a beginner trader or whether you're an expert trader, you would realize this fact yourself as you're going through your career or as you are already quite established in your career. So let's get to it, our daytime auction rotations. Now you need to think of the marketplace as a game in which time frame buyers and In its simplest sense, when buy is in control, prices rise. When sellers are in control, prices fall. This is the basic premise of auctions. Now, when only one participant is in control, the market tends to one time frame. When neither party is in complete control, price fluctuates up and down as one side pulls and tires, then the other side steps in. When control is shared, we exhibit a rotating market.", "transcript": "Welcome to part 7 guys and I hope you managed to get that playbook done and it's all updated and starting to take a real good shape now as we move through to the back end of module 2.

Now these two markets can be highlighted as either two time framing markets where neither participant has control or one time framing markets where we see initiative from one time frame and full control from that one time frame. Now note, one time framing is an aggressive pattern. Volume is therefore not important. So you do not want to be fading a one time framing pattern. The reason I say volume is not important is that when we see this one time framing it could be a result, well it's generally a result of one time frame needs to execute over the period of the day.
