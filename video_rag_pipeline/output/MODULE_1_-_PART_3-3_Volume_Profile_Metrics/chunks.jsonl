Here is an exhaustive list of the volume profile metrics you can expect to see not just in this module, but across all the modules as we go over this course. Do take note, whilst this list seems quite extensive and confusing, we will start to break them down individually over the next couple of slides. So what are the key identifiable volume profile metrics? and the low. As the name suggests, this is where the market opens on the day, where it closes on the day, the highest price traded on the day and the lowest price traded on the day. The next key identifiable metric is the daily range. That is the high minus the low. Then we have the initial balance range. This is the first hour of trading This is usually depicted in traditional European markets as the K and the L TPO. TPO stands for Time Price Opportunity. Again, we will talk about this further in further slides to come. Then we have the cash range. Now the cash range is typically the hour after the initial balance, so it's the second hour of trading in the day. This traditionally gets depicted with an M and an N TPO print. Note, however, that it doesn't have to be an M and an N, it can be any letter. We are just, for ease of understanding, we're going to use M and N. We then have the volume value area plus traditional value areas. The volume value area is simply the area of the distribution where 70% of the day's volume is transacted at. In terms of a traditional value error, this is just 70% of the time of the day where the market transacts at. Then the value area range. This is simply the distance between the high and the low of the value area of the day. Single prints are merely a single TPO or a single time price opportunity that exists within a daily profile. Again, we will talk more about this down the line, so do not worry too much if you don't understand this at the moment. We are merely just going through the various identifiable metrics within volume profiles. We then have low volume nodes and high volume nodes. Low volume nodes is where little or very little volume trades over a period of a day, where high volume nodes is where a high amount of volume is transacted over a day. We then have tails. These can be buying tails or selling tails. Buying tails", "transcript": "Next, Volume Profile Metrics.
