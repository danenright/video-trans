I hope you've finished everything managed to succeed in your 30-day challenge And congratulations I hope it's been a very fulfilling experience for you and finally you do grasp the footprint course in its entirety now The bonus material obviously I haven't really let leak exactly what the bonus material is going to be But it's going to be all about Bitcoin I think the reason being it doesn't exist. I don't think anyone on the globe has thought about utilizing the footprint course with the Bitcoin and that's why we're going to speak about it. I think Bitcoin is something that is now yet to stay. We obviously have all four of the major global futures exchanges offering the product. So again, if you want to be an early adopter, take advantage of the Bitcoin product. The footprint tool is actually very, very interesting and I'm going to show you some fantastic opportunities with the Bitcoin and the footprint tool. Okay, so this is how we're going to do it. This is what the stream is going to but about setup. Okay, so what we're going to talk about in terms of the setup is very simple. I'm going to talk about, you know, how to set up your chart, time-based, rotational, etc. and all that so that you can utilize the information in an effective manner. Once we've spoken about the setup, we're going to talk about why this tool. Okay, so why will this tool work well? Why this tool work well? This is important, guys, because I think a big mistake people make is they tend to sometimes utilize the same tool across different markets and expect to get the same sort of information coming to them. That's important. Some tools are going to work slightly better in certain environments and some tools aren't going to work as well. This is where knowing the nuance of the tool and really understanding what a tool does will come in handy. Okay, and this is, again, as your mentor, this is going to be pretty much what the stream is about. I'm going to give you a process that you can adopt. Like I gave you the template within the actual footprint course, I'm going to give you a bit of a template now to start you off. And again, remember, don't take what I say as is. Make sure you develop your own template, your own understanding, and your own edge ultimately with trading the Bitcoin. Okay, once you've dealt with the process, I'm then going to move into the fun part. You remember those strategies you dealt with throughout the footprint course that we spent a lot of time on. We're then going to adopt those strategies into one trading session. I think that's exciting. I'll tell you right now, we found six strategies, six of the ten strategies that you learned in the course, we found those in one five-hour trading session.

Okay, let's get straight into it then. the recording of the footprint and we can go from there. Okay, so the first thing and this is where a lot of people looking at this are probably going to wonder how on earth do I go about this. Well, the first thing to note is obviously you're going to see a lot of zeros. So how do we set this up? How are we going to set this footprint course up? Or sorry, this Bitcoin up so that we can actually make any kind of meaningful sense of it. The first thing is that we need to decide whether we're going to go rotational or whether we're going to go time-based. Now for me again, obviously do bear in mind guys, I've played around with this only briefly. So again, it's up to you to sort of take a few ideas and go enhance those ideas for yourself for me though I think right now there's no point in working with rotational Okay, why well simply speaking Bitcoin is moving in the ranges of a thousand five hundred dollars Okay, so what rotation are you going to use? Obviously, when we spoke about some of the rotations we used throughout the course, it made sense to use, for instance, a 0.1% rotation in the e-mini S&P. It made sense to use maybe a 10 tick rotation in the gold. Why? Because 10 ticks equals $1. That made sense. However, with Bitcoin right now, it's too volatile to have any kind of meaningful rotation and that's why we're not going to use a rotation for Bitcoin. Now again, throughout the course we used one minute time base, five minutes. Why? Because I really wanted to show you the interaction that was taking place in all the markets. However, again... because you know Bitcoin at the moment it's very illiquid, you know sometimes it doesn't move for five minutes alright, sometimes a contract doesn't even trade for fifteen minutes. So there's no point in us using a shorter term time frame in terms of the footprint. What we are going to do is I am going to recommend you look at either a thirty minute, a sixty minute or even a daily time frame. Alright, now for me, for the purpose of this example, this is going to be time-based, it's going to be a 30-minute time-based.

Again, for me that shows enough information that allows me to drill in and have a real look at what's actually going on on the footprint. Alright, now once we've got that time-frame sorted, we then want to talk briefly about shading. keep it simple. Don't play with the shading too much. Again, shading won't help you yet. Why? Because we're only trading a couple of hundred contracts at the moment. So if we're doing five, six hundred contracts a day, you can have five different shades, but again it's not going to show you anything meaningful. So whilst it's illiquid, keep the shading to the traditional three. Down the line, obviously, if we do start trading a lot of volume in the months and weeks ahead, by all means, play with that shading so long as it adds information. Keep it simple. Okay, so with that being said, we've pretty much got our setup sorted now. We're going 30 minutes and we're going three shades. In terms of what you can see in front of you before I get playing, we've got the footprint obviously on the left, we've got the price ladder in the middle, and we've got a 30 minute chart on the right side. Okay, now, obviously remember we spoke a lot about cross-pollination between tools. I want to start with the technical structure that you're looking at. Now this is obviously to put things into context because context is important. If we go back to yesterday, in essence what you were looking at was a really full-bodied red candle. What had happened was it was the launch of the CME on Monday, which was the 18th. and we have been stuck inside this range. So the market had kind of been almost forming a bit of an inside day within the Monday open. And that's where we are now. We're stuck inside this sideways range. The Bitcoin is being, obviously every time it's getting sold off, the sellers are disappearing and the market's then bouncing. And equally every time it's running into sort of resistance around the $19,500 to $20,000 level, Okay, so that's where we are guys. Now let's roll the tape and let's play with us and let's go through a few things. Okay, actually before we get there, let's quickly come back to the whiteboard and just discuss the other elements. So the first thing I want to talk about is why. Okay, it's the big why. Why use Footprint for this tool?

Participants, right? So at the moment who is trading Bitcoin? I can tell you right now. You've got market makers Why because they have an incentive Okay, so what's a market makers incentive? Well, he's there to make a market All right. He doesn't speculate doesn't care where price goes He just simply makes a market and obviously gets some very good rebates as a result. Then you've got a couple of speculators Now the speculators, obviously retail, maybe a couple of hedge funds, a couple of small fry, maybe a couple of, I don't want to say banks because that might be a little dangerous, but again we got a number of different speculators in the market. And then the last sort of type of participant, and again I'm going to use this word loosely, are hedges. I don't know how many people are hedging Bitcoin, again the product was created It's good to know, obviously a hedger's objective is not price directional, rather it's to manage risk. Alright, so in terms of that, if we look at the participants, we can see we've got a few market makers not price sensitive, we've got a couple of hedgers not price sensitive and speculators very price sensitive. Alright, so why is it that I think the footprint is so good with regards to trading the Bitcoin? Well, it's simple. Because there are so few participants, i.e. you didn't see me show once there any algorithms, so because there's minimal participation, what that implies is that when there is participation, you're going to see it very clearly. You're going to see precisely, i.e. what a speculator is going to try and do. You're going to see precisely what a market maker is trying to do, and you're going to see precisely what a hedge is going to do, and that's the key. and then another, and then another, you're going to determine what their strategy, what their approach is. And that's where, but when I show it to you on the footprint in a minute, you're going to see that it's almost magnified, it's a thing of beauty actually, how when there's few participants, the footprint actually stands out as a very strong trading tool.

Every single day, and again, I'm going to use this word process synonymous to templates, so templating. So I'm going to write up your metrics and give it an underline. So we need to look at volume, okay? That can be daily volume, that can be volume on a 60 minute. Then we need to look at things like delta, as well as cumulative delta, as well as positioning. And again, these are all terms you have been dealing with quite extensively over the course so I'm not going to go through them, but these are the metrics you want to look into. The end of day comes, you've traded the Bitcoin, you've observed it, now you need to go and form a template, a process of how can I observe, how can I view, and how can I then develop strategy and approach from there. So i.e. if we come in and we see a day, it's the highest volume since the launch of Bitcoin, it's two times the amount of volume we did, what did the market respond? Was there a lot of absorption? Was there a lot of initiative? Was there a lot of two-way trade? What was happening as a result of that high volume? You determine that and ultimately you are going to learn something new about the market. And you do the same for the delta. Was there any position, delta unwind? We spoke a lot about delta positioning and delta unwind as well as pocket positioning. What happens in terms of the delta? Was there net positioning on the day? Okay, and you go and look in your determined strategy based on that. You can then think about cumulative delta as well as positioning. Those are the kinds of things you want to look at when determining a process that you can adopt to trading the Bitcoin. Okay, now obviously what I would say, we went quite extensively through that template. Don't be afraid to adopt that same template or at least elements of that template into Okay, because the structures will remain the same, the same principles you are learning with those other strategies will apply to the Bitcoin as well.

Now once you've got this and what I urge you to do is before you then jump in and It's very likely that not many people will be trading this, reason being is that there's not many retail brokers at the moment that will offer this in the futures. The margins are excessively high. To put it into perspective, we're looking at 44% of the underlying is required by the exchange from your broker. price of roughly $20,000. We're looking somewhere in the region of about $8,000 to $9,000. That's effectively the margin requirement now. Most retail traders don't have relatively large accounts. Okay, so one lot is effectively going to cost you $8,000 to $9,000 required on account. Okay, so to put that into perspective, you're probably not going to be trading the futures. However, it doesn't mean you can't have access via maybe spread bettors, maybe via CFDs, et cetera, et cetera. So don't be afraid to try this on a small scale. Get stuck and start getting a feel for it. Before I move on one thing. I do want to talk about with regards to obviously the ladder And this is where we're going to end before I get you on there is note obviously the type of volume Okay, so what you'll see currently on the ladder, and this is the danger of Bitcoin This is why brokers are not interested right now is effectively. We are seeing a 10 Tick to almost 20 tick spread Okay So to put things in perspective, obviously Bitcoin is trading in $5 increments, so we're going from $25 to $30 to $35 to $40 and obviously to $20 to $15 to $10. So we're trading in $5 increments on the price ladder. Now note, if we're doing a 10 tick spread when we're already trading in $5 increments, You've got to remember that effectively, what you're going to be seeing on the ladder is roughly a $50 to $75 range. Now again, I don't want to scare you away, I just want to put things into perspective so you understand the nature of the market. In terms of that, if that's the spread, $50 to $75, and we're trading $25 a tick, you can imagine that you know to cross the spread or i.e. to hit the market you're going to be paying anything between you're just going to be paying almost three four hundred dollars just to enter the market and that's the key that's the takeaway to be aggressive i.e. to be aggressive in this market is going to cost you", "transcript": "Okay, because the structures will remain the same, the same principles you are learning with those other strategies will apply to the Bitcoin as well. Alright, so that's the process that we're going to adopt. Now once you've got this and what I urge you to do is before you then jump in and It's very likely that not many people will be trading this, reason being is that there's not many retail brokers at the moment that will offer this in the futures. The margins are excessively high. To put it into perspective, we're looking at 44% of the underlying is required by the exchange from your broker. price of roughly $20,000. We're looking somewhere in the region of about $8,000 to $9,000. That's effectively the margin requirement now. Most retail traders don't have relatively large accounts. Okay, so one lot is effectively going to cost you $8,000 to $9,000 required on account. Okay, so to put that into perspective, you're probably not going to be trading the futures. However, it doesn't mean you can't have access via maybe spread bettors, maybe via CFDs, et cetera, et cetera. So don't be afraid to try this on a small scale. Get stuck and start getting a feel for it. Before I move on one thing. I do want to talk about with regards to obviously the ladder And this is where we're going to end before I get you on there is note obviously the type of volume Okay, so what you'll see currently on the ladder, and this is the danger of Bitcoin This is why brokers are not interested right now is effectively. We are seeing a 10 Tick to almost 20 tick spread Okay So to put things in perspective, obviously Bitcoin is trading in $5 increments, so we're going from $25 to $30 to $35 to $40 and obviously to $20 to $15 to $10. So we're trading in $5 increments on the price ladder. Now note, if we're doing a 10 tick spread when we're already trading in $5 increments, You've got to remember that effectively, what you're going to be seeing on the ladder is roughly a $50 to $75 range.

Again I'm going to show you how effective this imbalance looked and ultimately how you can adopt that into your Bitcoin analysis. So those are the six strategies we got all on the same day. Let's get into that price ladder and let's go through them one by one. Now the important thing to understand guys is as I go through this, again don't fret too much as you can't see much on the footprint. That's not the purpose of this, I'm going to point it out to you, I'm going to show you what it looks like, again by now the footprint ladder shouldn't matter much because you've got access to that and the reason it shouldn't matter is because you've learned all of these principles. I'm just pointing them out to you, I'm doing the debrief with you to show you that Bitcoin can be extremely effectively traded with the footprint. So let's draw the attention to the right side, we're going to start off just talk about the structure. Nice 30-minute structure and we can see obviously a little bit of initiative the day before, some real aggressive sell-side action, note the volumes and ultimately we then had one support, twice support, three times support and four times support. So a traditional trend line. Now, as we said, initiative, that was strategy number one. The first thing to understand about initiative is we want to see a pick up in volume, volatility and directional bias. At the same time, we want to see the delta move in the direction of the trend. To start off with, I'm going to push player and the first thing I want you to observe Okay, so what you can see right now is that we have broken, we've broken down below that level of 11.63, I'm going to mark it here so that you can see it on the chart, it's going to come in around this level. So that's the level we're looking at, that is the break of the trend line. Now the first thing to observe is note the lack of trade just before it. So the market's taken the level out and we've not seen a single counter, but what is one sell-side order, one sell-side match-buy, one buy-side. Okay, so maybe someone's taken some profit. Now, before we move on and actually talk a little bit about this drive and watch the drive in play, I want to just bring your attention to where we are in the current moment. So what we can see on the day, right now, we are negative delta of minus 22. Now again,", "transcript": "I'm going to show you a beautiful example, it was incredible how tidy this was.

So what we can see on the day, right now, we are negative delta of minus 22. Now again, this is so important, okay. A lot of you might go, yeah but that's not a negative delta. Bear in mind that on the day we were talking, at this point in time, we'd probably only done about 100 contracts. To put things into perspective, we'd only done 100 contracts and the delta was negative 22. That's a really, really large delta very early on in the day. We could see that sell-side bias coming in very early on in the session. That's what we're going to focus on. We're going to focus on this initiative drive now, watch how the market drives, In terms of the initiative drive, it's not necessarily always about getting on it, it's not always that easy and straightforward, but what we definitely don't do on initiative drive is we definitely don't go counter it, let it be. But once we've observed that initiative drive, like I showed you in the footprint course, once you've observed that initiative drive, don't be afraid to wait for that retracement and get stuck in. Okay, so let's look at this initiative drive and see what happens over the course So we can see obviously now we're still trading around that key break of $8.63 and we're going to see that market now take it out. So straight away we've now continued, we've made a new low on the day. And notice what's happening, okay? This is where the delta is interesting. Remember what I said, in an initiative drive you should see very little counter trade, i.e. you should not be seeing anyone buying the market, anyone supporting the market. Now what we can see straight away, obviously the market's broken below that $6.3 level we have one sell order, we have a second sell order, and someone then tries to buy the market. What happens when he does buy the market? Straight away, as soon as he buys, another sell order goes through and another sell order. Now, just to put things into context, that's roughly, what is that, a $100 drop? Almost a $100 drop. Since that buyer, he bought a one lot and we've dropped another $100. Note the delta. Still neg 3, neg 3. To put things into perspective, our biggest negative half-hour rotation for the day is minus 11. Now let's continue on with the video. So we can see again, the market's continuing to auction, and we can see again another bit of one-lots going through. Now note these participants. What will these be? Someone sitting below the low of the day. What will those be? Well, they're not going to be speculative longs. They might be, but most likely those are simply going to be market makers. Okay, so again, note another sell order goes through, and note suddenly a first buy order comes through. Now, this is the important thing to learn about Bitcoin, okay, and this is where the footprint is going to be so beautiful. You want to observe where the sellers are interacting, where the buyers are interacting, okay?", "transcript": "Now, before we move on and actually talk a little bit about this drive and watch the drive in play, I want to just bring your attention to where we are in the current moment.

Instantly, we see a seller sell, okay, and it sells down lower again. But now note what happens, and this is where I think it's lovely. Note the pattern repetition, okay? with gaps or spreads in between. This is the first time now, note, this is the first time that we've seen market makers making a market at two consecutive prices. So we've observed something which is we saw market makers at consecutive prices making the market. Now we want to see again, we want to just log that into the back of our memory because we want to see what happens now once the market finally goes back bid. Does this hold? So straight away, look what we've just seen, the market's gone lower again, and what have we seen? So the market goes lower, and straight away, there are those two prices, straight away a market maker lifts the market, so we've had someone step in to buy the market, and the moment he stepped in to buy the market, what did we see? Someone else bought the market, and someone else bought the market. Okay, and that's what we observe guys. We just observed market was coming down. It had sold off quite extensively Quite a strong move almost five hundred dollars bang bang We saw two market makers putting a bit in the market They both got filled it went one tick low and bang the market maker hit the market bought it and straight away We saw two more lots go through Okay. Now again. I know that might not sound a lot, but let's put into perspective, right? So over the course of the day the highest volume we saw was on the breakout. That was 15 contracts Now in the space of five minutes, what have we seen? We've seen one, two, three, we've seen six contracts trading in the space of five minutes. And that's the pick up, that's the nuance, that's what we're looking for. Now this was our second strategy effectively, which is what we call a key auction reversal. Why? Because... When we went through the trade strategies in the course I showed you guys that an effective low a strong low or strong high the first thing we need to see is we need to See someone responding to that low price. Okay more importantly the speed at which the response occurs That's the key. All right a market that comes down and spends a lot of time responding It's still a good low potentially, but ultimately it's not a very strongly auctioned low however a market that comes down Finds a market making and it's just straightaway pounces back off. That is what we call a very key auction Reversal and that's what you're gonna see You're gonna see now the price action completely shifts in this and I mean you can really see that the bit price of Bitcoin Has gone all the way from 18 300 back up in and around to 18 500", "transcript": "Okay, so again, note another sell order goes through, and note suddenly a first buy order comes through.

Okay, so step one we saw the We saw the initial initiative break out to win from 873 down to 250 to 60 a nice $500 drive we then ran into the market makers and we saw a very strong key Auction reversal now remember what we said those key auction reversals We want to put a nice colorful line why I spoke to you guys about color lines what they represent Okay, key auction reversals once we take them out right we do tend to get follow through Why? Because a key auction reversal is telling us that some significant buyers are stepping into the market to support the market. More importantly, don't forget, a key auction reversal has a very good bounce. It's not a shallow bounce, it tends to be a very strong bounce. Again, we spoke about that quite extensively earlier on in the footprint course. I want to turn our attention to the third trade opportunity, which is effectively the absorption and auctioning. In other words, we said when you have an initiative drive, in terms of the pattern, what we're looking for is the market to bounce once we find that absorption. That's where we want to be switched on. Why? Because when we find that absorption, eventually it's going to resolve itself and we're then going to get the auction in either direction. Now the either direction, if it goes to the upside, obviously that's the delta unwind strategy. If it continues in the direction of the trend, that's simply just obviously the retracement or the absorption and auctioning strategy. So let's go find that now, let's go and have a look, in fact we can see it straight away. So the markets come up and we can see now, I'm just going to just rewind this fraction so you can see it being done. So we can see the first little bit, and this is something I noticed, and I've just run that down a little bit. Watch this $18,500. Again, the price there is not going to be a great help for this. Why? Because as you can see, there's not much you can see on that price there. It's kind of just all over the show. So this is where the footprint is going to be far more handy. What I want you to do is watch that $18,500. What happens when we come up there? You can see currently the market's now bid at $18,500. from the lows of just below 300. So we've done 250 odd dollars. This is the first time we actually see a sell-side response. Now what we're looking for, remember, we've got the sell-off, we've got the bounce. What we're looking for here is we're looking for the market response. We're looking for a seller to step in and start absorbing the market and getting involved. That's what you're going to see in a couple of", "transcript": "Reversal and that's what you're gonna see You're gonna see now the price action completely shifts in this and I mean you can really see that the bit price of Bitcoin Has gone all the way from 18 300 back up in and around to 18 500 So we've bounced two hundred and fifty dollars just simply off that little bit of price action from the footprint. Okay, so step one we saw the We saw the initial initiative break out to win from 873 down to 250 to 60 a nice $500 drive we then ran into the market makers and we saw a very strong key Auction reversal now remember what we said those key auction reversals We want to put a nice colorful line why I spoke to you guys about color lines what they represent Okay, key auction reversals once we take them out right we do tend to get follow through Why? Because a key auction reversal is telling us that some significant buyers are stepping into the market to support the market. More importantly, don't forget, a key auction reversal has a very good bounce. It's not a shallow bounce, it tends to be a very strong bounce. Again, we spoke about that quite extensively earlier on in the footprint course. I want to turn our attention to the third trade opportunity, which is effectively the absorption and auctioning. In other words, we said when you have an initiative drive, in terms of the pattern, what we're looking for is the market to bounce once we find that absorption. That's where we want to be switched on. Why? Because when we find that absorption, eventually it's going to resolve itself and we're then going to get the auction in either direction. Now the either direction, if it goes to the upside, obviously that's the delta unwind strategy. If it continues in the direction of the trend, that's simply just obviously the retracement or the absorption and auctioning strategy. So let's go find that now, let's go and have a look, in fact we can see it straight away. So the markets come up and we can see now, I'm just going to just rewind this fraction so you can see it being done. So we can see the first little bit, and this is something I noticed, and I've just run that down a little bit. Watch this $18,500. Again, the price there is not going to be a great help for this. Why? Because as you can see, there's not much you can see on that price there. It's kind of just all over the show. So this is where the footprint is going to be far more handy.

I'm just going to move this a little bit forward. Okay, go back one what you're going to see is that's going to move to a two lot. So you're going to see a little bit of transactional flow coming in. Now the first thing to note is note the volume. Remember what we said with a key auction reversal, you're always going to see really high volume. Okay, so straight away, bang, note, we've had a buyer step in. Where's he stepped in? At higher prices. Now it's he's found a seller, okay, because in order for him to buy, he has to buy it off of a seller. Now note, obviously, we can see we've traded 15 contracts. Okay, so the highest volume of the day. We've still got a very strong negative delta at this point Okay, and what we've seen now is the markets come up and we found obviously a seller at the 18500 and straight away we can see that another sellers been hit another sellers been hit So if you come look up, you're very interesting again it almost looked like a carbon copy of the low. The market was searching for a seller. It found the initial seller at, call it, $18,530. It then found another seller at $550 and then someone eventually got more aggressive and sold the market at $18,560. Okay, and that's the absorption guys, that was the interaction right there, buyers coming up the market, trying to find that seller, and bang he finds that seller. The seller takes not just one, two contracts, not just absorbs, but he also then hits the market for one, and straight away, notice what he does, he hits for one up here, and he hits the next best price for another two at $18,500. Okay, do the math, so we've had one contract trader, two, three, four, we've had six contracts trade in the last one minute, that's the seller. All in relative terms, guys. Six contracts is pretty much, it's as good as volume is going to get. If you note, obviously you can see in some of the previous rotations, six contracts is sometimes more than we do in an entire half-hour contract. We did it in one minute. That's the clue. That's the subtlety. There's your seller. Now, straight away, we call this the pocket positioning. Why? Because that's where the seller is now. We can see him there. He's just taken six contracts from the market. Now again, in terms of a participant, definitely a market maker there. Could definitely be someone who's speculating, i.e. trying to get filled on a short. Maybe someone long taking profit. Maybe even someone hedging a position on the bounce. That's our clue.

That might be a stop, it might be someone buying, it might be a hedger, but it's definitely not someone who's price-sensitive because he just bought the market almost a good $150 higher. Now let's see what happens once he buys that market, let's see how the market responds to this. So bear in mind, prices are substantially higher, we've just drifted a significant Let's just fast-forward this on, okay. All of a sudden, someone sells it straight back down. Okay, so we're in that distribution. We sell straight back down. The next best lot traded, again, almost $150 lower. And again, I'm going to fast-forward this on because this is the auctioning part now. This is where it gets very interesting. Okay, the next lot, as we can see, is the previous one. The next best lot trades, again, almost 200 contracts lower. Okay, so three total contracts in a space of almost, what, a $600 range.

Okay, note again the Delta just to run that up again We are now minus 31 in terms of the Delta on the day and let's see what happens when we approach the low Okay, so our low is taken out remember This was our key low why because we had market makers there as well as buyers step in okay key low gets taken out What do we see the most important thing on a breakout? We don't see any counter bid okay, so not a single buyer in the market on the other side That's what we want to see in a breakout. We don't want to see the counter trade, just the initiative, the aggression to the downside. And straight away, what do we see? Someone steps in, not to absorb the market.

So aggressive buyer, market maker gets filled and all of a sudden what do we get? Straight away, very aggressive buyer. Not waiting, not hanging around, not being passive lifts the next best price and straight away what do we see? Bang! One, two, three, four contracts lifting at higher prices, okay? And that's the beauty of it.

We had one sell order go through and what did that buyer do?

Okay, and then this plays out, you'll see now we have a really nice bounce, we can see obviously the, again, nice strong buyer, not waiting for fills, no real selling interaction, I think that was the key. Markets eventually just continued to retrace higher and we got that failed break of support and resistance. Okay, eventually note however, that did subside, the buyers took some profits and what did we get, sell side, sell side, sell side, sell side. Okay, and guess what, take a guess where that sell side came in, well I'll give you a clue, it was that same bit of pocket positioning that we saw around the $18,500 1800-18600 area. We spoke a lot about this throughout the course. The market went back, tested that 1800-18500 and what did we see? We not only saw the strong buyer backing off, but we saw those sellers stepping in a very meaningful way, again selling four contracts, re-establishing that negative delta on the rotation as well as the negative delta on the day. Okay, and that's pretty much how it played out guys. Now, It was the imbalances taking place and I briefly want to touch upon this, again I don't want you to get too bogged down, but I just want you to understand a little bit of the interpretation of the imbalancer. I just want to move this across a little bit and bring you back to that 18500 area that we were talking about. Okay, so let's have a look here, let's talk a little bit briefly about imbalances. This is the area we're talking about, the pocket positioning. We spoke about that quite a lot throughout the course. But this is where I want to sort of finish this off and talk about imbalances. So if you were to look at this, now remember imbalance, obviously we're looking across the way. We're looking at the buying versus selling relationship or are the buyers being more aggressive at higher prices versus sellers at lower prices. Straight away what you can see in this pocket positioning is that there's a massive sell imbalance not just because of the color I mean probably the Delta at the bottom gives it away, but let's look at it Okay, so the markets come up to this eighteen five hundred area and what's happening? Okay firstly what we saw was absorption All right, so straight away Initially what we got well sorry the absorption came a little bit higher all right That's the absorption name so a market came up, and it gave anyone on the offer a fill But the moment that seller got filled passively, what did he do? He went bang, and he went bang, and he went bang, and he went bang, and he went bang.", "transcript": "We didn't get the fill. We had one sell order go through and what did that buyer do? Alright, so all we're seeing is a continuation of this very aggressive buyer who won, bought off the load, didn't absorb, we then got an absorption, he then lifted, not just one but four more contracts at best price possible. Very aggressive buyer. Okay, and then this plays out, you'll see now we have a really nice bounce, we can see obviously the, again, nice strong buyer, not waiting for fills, no real selling interaction, I think that was the key. Markets eventually just continued to retrace higher and we got that failed break of support and resistance. Okay, eventually note however, that did subside, the buyers took some profits and what did we get, sell side, sell side, sell side, sell side. Okay, and guess what, take a guess where that sell side came in, well I'll give you a clue, it was that same bit of pocket positioning that we saw around the $18,500 1800-18600 area. We spoke a lot about this throughout the course. The market went back, tested that 1800-18500 and what did we see? We not only saw the strong buyer backing off, but we saw those sellers stepping in a very meaningful way, again selling four contracts, re-establishing that negative delta on the rotation as well as the negative delta on the day. Okay, and that's pretty much how it played out guys. Now, It was the imbalances taking place and I briefly want to touch upon this, again I don't want you to get too bogged down, but I just want you to understand a little bit of the interpretation of the imbalancer.

He went bang, and he went bang, and he went bang, and he went bang, and he went bang. There was so much sell-side orders coming in once we hit this $18,500. We then saw a secondary attempt. But what was the secondary attempt? This is the key. When the buyers then turned again, what did they do? Only bought two lots. So we see in this entire area, this entire range, what was happening was the buyers In other words, the buyers were not being aggressive at higher prices. They were being passive, of course, because we can see all this selling has to sell to a buyer. So the buyers were passive at higher prices, but they were definitely not aggressive. On the flip side, what were the sellers doing? Were the sellers being aggressively selling? 100% yes. You can't see any kind of sell side getting filled here. Why? Because the buyers weren't buying from them. And the buyers were forced to accept the higher prices. And that's the key, guys. In terms of the pocket positioning, there was a massive imbalance here of a lot of sell side pressure. The sellers were really, really being aggressive in this $18,500 up to, call it $18,575. The real tip of the iceberg, and this is kind of where you want to finish it off, but the real tip of the iceberg was when that market did suddenly trade a one lot at $710. The speed at which it got hit back down. I mean, I'm just going to show you that very briefly the speed at which it got hit Back down. I mean we're talking about one lot traded. Okay, the next lot traded at 18500 and the last lot traded 18360 so we went all the way from seven hundred dollars or eighteen thousand seven hundred all the way down to eighteen three sixty Okay, good four hundred three hundred fifty dollar move on three contracts. Okay again. When was that? Where was that initiated by it wasn't initiated by the buyers? Okay, one buyer maybe stopped out, a seller got filled and straight away the seller stepped in and hit the market quite hard. Alright, that's it guys, that's the Bitcoin summary, that's Bitcoin debrief, that's the footprint in action and I think, again, I hope that illustrates not just how effective this tool can be, but how effective it can be in terms of the interpretation of they are minimal participants.
