In fact, you're not doing what only a few are doing, you're doing what everyone is likely to do. There are not many people that want to spend their time filling out a template.

Again, briefly I'm going to go over that.

Now we didn't quite go into how to execute, how to get involved with them, how to identify them and where the opportunity is and that's what the strategy session is going to be all about. Now the most important thing is obviously in terms of the shape, we call this a Okay, so the name comes very simply we get initiative into a lower price just before the low is found we tend to get a really high amount of absorption or known as responsive buying the market then runs into a certain price point now note This price point is not definable. I think anyone that thinks that they can pick a top and a bottom or a market That doesn't understand the underlying principles behind the market. Okay.

So why spend our time and energy trying to find prices and try to find the low points and the turning points where we can simply adopt the process where we identify the price response prior to a potential turning point we identify on the footprint a few other types of responses and then we simply execute on that. Okay, that brings us back to the whole concept again of having a subjective opinion which is guessing at which price the market might turn around at or looking at the facts and executing based on the facts. Okay, now let's go through some of the other principles that you're going to find in this strategy and I'm just going to graphically annotate them. This is known as initiative to initiative we spoke about this so we tend to see the market Initiate in a trend like fashion Okay, it will run into obviously responsive buyers on the way down. Why because as price moves lower, you're gonna have a response from buyers Eventually, it will reach a certain price point where we will see initiation in the opposite direction now note We say this in unit 3, one of the most important factors is when we get that initiation in the opposite direction, you tend to get little pockets or pocket positioning of absorption on the way up. We call this response of selling or secondary response of selling. Why? Well, it's simple. Obviously in this down move, in this first little move down, you're likely to have a couple of people caught along, so when the market does finally bounce, they're simply trying to get out of those positions. As the market's been going down you might have had participants trying to average, trying to buy more, just manage those positions a little bit better. So again when that market bounces they tend to get out of those positions. You also get new potential shorts entering where the market finding bounces and last but not least you get a little bit of profit taking as some might buy the low and look for small targets. Okay so that's the basic premise of the initiative to the downside and initiative again Now, note, obviously, this will look a lot more trend-like, okay, so there is going to be a real lack of liquidity, remember, initiative by the very definition means that there is volume or business that's required, okay, so there's business to be done and that requires volume, now, obviously, if the market, you know, if there is liquidity being that will determine how big the range will be.

Equally once the market does go back but up once we take out those little pockets of positioning as explained earlier you then might find also some imbalances in the opposite direction now do note we did speak yesterday we spoke about how not yesterday sorry we did speak in there in earlier units uh all about you know imbalances and how they do tend to get filled out so if there is an imbalance on the first leg of initiative and fill out that imbalance on the way back up okay and again we will talk a little bit about this and how we can utilize this for execution in a bit now in terms of some of the key metrics obviously in terms of the context where you could find this initiative to initiative price response it's not something you see very often okay that's the first thing to note it does tend to come when markets are in an imbalanced state in other words the markets A larger time frame participant decides that price is now at a point that it's deemed a real discount. Okay, in this example, this would be a discount, or in this example, the market's at a real premium. Okay, so the market reaches a point where you know We are at a real discount and a real premium and therefore we get initiation in the opposite direction This does tend to come when markets are no longer in balance Okay, because by the definition of imbalance it means the markets are in a price discovery mode and they are discovering a series of prices now Some things to pay attention to in terms of volume and Delta You will see high volume on both the down leg and the up leg or both leg one and leg two You will see a very high volume Okay, this is obvious simply because we know that with initiative as we spoke about in the the unit on initiative drives An initiative simply means business in the market and by definition volume now as we are obviously initiating in one direction we have got the potential as mentioned to leave either imbalances or what we call low volume areas and obviously as mentioned the delta will", "transcript": "volume or business that's required, okay, so there's business to be done and that requires volume, now, obviously, if the market, you know, if there is liquidity being that will determine how big the range will be.

I don't want to give you an exact hard fast rule, but in general time based rotations Okay time based rotations Are going to generally work well or better when okay when the principle? requires focus on relative change So what do we mean by that very simply? If the single most important thing is to see a really rapid shift in the volume, it's going to be far easier to see that rapid shift on a time-based time frame. Why? Because if we're looking at five-minute rotations, that's a rotation, that's a rotation, that's a rotation, and we've done 2,000 contracts, 2,000 and suddenly 10,000, we're going to pick up that variance or that really big relative shift. far quicker than if we're looking on a rotation. Equally time-based rotations work far better when time is the key proponent. So when time is a really important factor in the strategy then obviously a time-based rotation is going to be better to use. Now rotational rotations they also have their place and in general again as a trend as a general rule of thumb we want to use them when the markets are trending when we can see flows in the market when there's momentum and trending rotations okay so obviously when the market is moving very trend like very aggressively okay what you'll pick up with rotation is that you'll", "transcript": "this reversal.

There are general rules of thumb to apply them But you can ultimately use one of the footprints pretty much for all of the strategies, okay? Obviously auction imbalances again. You know there. There is a general rule of thumb for me auction imbalances are best used to identify imbalances, you're probably going to miss out on other types of information just having an auction of imbalance, especially if you're focusing on the delta colouring. Ok, that's the one thing you won't see on an auction of imbalance. So my suggestion, my recommendation, if this is a screen and you have all the footprints, I would simply have three different footprint charts all illustrating potentially maybe rotation on the right okay and I'll have them all for the same market and then you could simply just create obviously as I've shown you you could simply just create all your markets and when you want to flick between them you simply just flick between the different markets okay so that's how I would recommend you view it but again it's entirely up to you okay let's get one or two other factors. So the two variations you're going to learn. One is very much a V-shaped type reversal and what you're going to find in this is as the market does turn to offer back over the initiative in the opposite direction as I said is first going to be met by volume but what it's going to feel like is it's going to feel like the markets really struggling to allow you in. Now on a footprint What this will appear like if I was to draw a footprint with a couple of prices What you're going to tend to see initially is you see some very dark colors So some really aggressive selling so what you're going to see is some real imbalances coming in from the seller So a real aggressive selling however.

Second, you might see again maybe some darker colors, so last gas buying, but then eventually once we get back below that base you should see relatively light Delta colors. So that's the first real variation you're going to see. It is going to feel like you're going to struggle to get in and I will show you some examples ahead. The This is the first of the strategies that's no longer standalone, but you'll see it on a candlestick, okay? So what you like you to see on these key auction reversals is some form of an engulfing candle So if these are your previous couple of candles Okay, your couple of rotational footprints What you like you to see is an engulfing candle now the most important proponents of an engulfing candle is one range expansion, two high volume okay and three in this case a weak close so you need a bit of an extreme type close. Now the strategy is very simple okay in terms of how we're going to execute this play what we're looking to do is we're ultimately looking to in the first example execute once the marker turns from absorbing on the bid side to absorbing The moment we see the absorption on the offer, that's when we want to enter the short Obviously if this was a normal V reversal We will be a buyer once the absorption comes in on the buy side in terms of obviously of using candlesticks It's very simple We wait for this candle to close Once we get that first put up we look for little pockets of positioning So anywhere on the footprint where we have real large amounts of volume that are traded the moment it retests that we want to be leaving limit orders there, so real passive orders there at that pocket of positioning for our entry point.

Let's now have a look at some of the practical examples. Okay, so let's take a look then that Our first example this is in the the gold market and it's from the 1st of December. Now the first thing I want to bring attention to is obviously the initiative so we can see the initiative being taken to the upside in the gold. Note obviously the high volume that's how we know it's initiative it's also very directional in trend like fashion. Note the imbalances we always want to point out those imbalances with potentially green lines. And as we said in the V-reverse, what we're looking for is some absorption to the upside. Once the market finds the top and turns back over, we expect to see two different bouts of absorption on the way down. The first bit, the buyers should be slightly more aggressive than the sellers, and then it switches over to the sellers being more aggressive than the buyers. And once we take out that point, we're looking for initiative. Now, I'm gonna point these out to you. So again as we come up we can see a little bit of absorption, not a great amount, so again you probably like to see better examples than this. Something a little bit like that would have been more ideal towards higher, just more sort of real responsive price behaviour from the sellers. of real aggression. Okay, what we can see here is obviously the buyer's being quite intentional. You know, the buyer's really just trying to keep the market bit up. Note once it got taken out, we then moved on to potentially our second little pocket. In this instance, what we're seeing now, if I draw a little bit of imbalance lines for you, you can really see how suddenly the sellers start to step it up and we start to see a little bit more of an aggressive sell-side response. So we shift away from obviously the buyers being more aggressive than the sellers in the first block. to the sellers becoming more aggressive than the buyers and that's key to to to the strategy. Obviously we need to see those sellers stepping up and initiate and obviously time is of importance. Now note these are obviously a five-minute rotation so it is quite nice and easy to see you can see the natural shape of the V. Now what we're looking for in terms of the trade strategy once the market does have this initial pullback into the imbalance area the market offers a bounce. Now, note where that bounce comes to. It comes all the way back to this really, really dark little area here. Okay, that seems to be the last area where the buyers took a stand. market testers was ready to be low volume and we could see both these prices okay relatively little volume traded there that would have been quite a nice clue and uh we then got a little bit of as we could again see some aggressive selling coming in", "transcript": "I'm showing you we are obviously looking for the flush down for the you know The real initiative in the opposite direction, but the real move comes the following session, okay?

Okay, what we can see here is obviously the buyer's being quite intentional. You know, the buyer's really just trying to keep the market bit up. Note once it got taken out, we then moved on to potentially our second little pocket. In this instance, what we're seeing now, if I draw a little bit of imbalance lines for you, you can really see how suddenly the sellers start to step it up and we start to see a little bit more of an aggressive sell-side response. So we shift away from obviously the buyers being more aggressive than the sellers in the first block. to the sellers becoming more aggressive than the buyers and that's key to to to the strategy. Obviously we need to see those sellers stepping up and initiate and obviously time is of importance. Now note these are obviously a five-minute rotation so it is quite nice and easy to see you can see the natural shape of the V. Now what we're looking for in terms of the trade strategy once the market does have this initial pullback into the imbalance area the market offers a bounce. Now, note where that bounce comes to. It comes all the way back to this really, really dark little area here. Okay, that seems to be the last area where the buyers took a stand. market testers was ready to be low volume and we could see both these prices okay relatively little volume traded there that would have been quite a nice clue and uh we then got a little bit of as we could again see some aggressive selling coming in", "ocr_text": null, "visual_caption": null, "metadata": {"chunk_idx": 12, "frame_refs": ["output/UNIT_12___Strategy_7_Key_Auction_Reversals_1-9/frames/scene_0002_end.jpg", "output/UNIT_12___Strategy_7_Key_Auction_Reversals_1-9/frames/scene_0003_start.jpg"]}}

So this is the oil market. All right, so let's take a look at our first example. This is from the WTR oil on the 16th of November. Obviously just some key things to focus on. Obviously as we're coming down we don't know where this is going to turn. We don't know what the initiative price action is. We're simply just observing the market and if we see certain elements or certain characteristics from the footprint we then execute based on the strategy. Now the first thing to note, notice how we get these really dark colors at the extreme. That's the from the buyer so we can see some real buying absorption coming in. The market then goes, extends lower and notes straight away, 329 traded at 95 potentially. We could have thought of that as a potential little elephant. Quite a lot of absorption there, one order, take Now again note the dark red colors so we can see some real buying absorption Taking place here. The buyers are happily getting hit here Happily providing liquidity to anyone willing to sell market goes extends again by another tick Notice the volume going through there. Okay, really low volume on that extension straight away back but below the 348 and again, we continue to see quite a lot of buyers to the silence now. Again this in its own does not signal any kind of potential trade strategy but what happens next potentially does now. I'm just going to fast-forward this slightly. So we can see obviously the market spends, obviously these are 5-minute rotations so we can see the market does spend a little bit of time in this lower rotation and we move from these dark colours to suddenly these light colors. That's the real key here. So obviously what we said is we want to see the market go from responsive, we want to see it initiate, run into those secondary sellers which we're seeing on this block. So we can see a real bunch of sellers getting involved, providing liquidity here. Once we take those out, again notice what happens now. So where those sellers are providing liquidity, notice how suddenly now we're getting the buyers into this block here but ultimately what we're getting is quite a lot of reloading coming in from the bite so that was our clue that was our signal when we see that we want to be looking to enter long before we then get the initiative leg we can see that initiative leg coming now real light volumes nice and balanced there 30 by 90", "transcript": "So by that definition, once we take that out, we should see quite a fast unwind.

It all depends on the context because we can see prices have come off the low quite aggressively Yes, there is more selling taking place here, but it's in the process of prices rising in other words There's more selling taking place only simply because buyers are holding much higher prices. Okay in that instance The likelihood is we're going to continue on higher. Okay. That's what we see. We continue to see this process of the unwind towards the upside we continue to see the initiation again. Notice the low volume area, notice the balance and also notice the follow through. Okay so that's our first example of what an auction reversal will look like. Do note we would go put a nice little nice little blue line down there if and only if it met the three principles of a really good auction high or low. The next example we're going to take a look at will be the E-Mini S&P 500. Again, note this is an embellished chart, also in a time frame. I just want to illustrate to you guys that you can use any one of the footprint tools and you're still going to see these rotations or these reversals. Now in this example This is a little bit of a softer version. This is that engulfing candle I'm going to show you so when it gets to the point where we do engulf so we can then take it from there Okay, so the market goes bid. Let's just draw it down a little bit. So let's see the process of going bid ya So the market gets to 2640 Notice obviously the market finds a bit of volatility above this 2640 why well we can see the candlestick chart Maybe a little bit of a break of a flag market extends, note the imbalance, okay, so we can see really aggressive blue lines there, nice imbalance, showing some aggression to the upside, really good amount of volumes transacted. Now what we're looking to happen ultimately is we're looking to see it initially, we're finding a response of yeah as we can see we're seeing the sellers respond. Once obviously the buyers have run into enough response of selling and the sellers step up and initiate in the we should see prices start to drift in the opposite direction and that's what you can see here. Obviously we can see that we see quite a lot of moving from a very aggressive buy side. We've seen that entire imbalance get filled out and we've actually seen the sellers stepping to become quite aggressive and that's the nature of this trade strategy.", "transcript": "is quite a lot of reloading coming in from the bite so that was our clue that was our signal when we see that we want to be looking to enter long before we then get the initiative leg we can see that initiative leg coming now real light volumes nice and balanced there 30 by 90 and continuation to the upside again notice the real block of absorption Thinking that red means that sellers are dominating the price response, okay?
