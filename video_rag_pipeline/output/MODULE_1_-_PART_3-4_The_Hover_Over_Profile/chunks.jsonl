As you can see in front of you, we have a traditional volume profile or a distribution. As you can see on the right of this distribution, we have prices. In the middle we have all sorts of letters. Now this session can vary in duration. Traditionally, most traders each letter represents a 30 minute time frame. However, we could use either weekly or monthly or longer term time frames, so it all depends. What we will be teaching you predominantly throughout this course is a day-to-day profile and therefore each letter represents a 30 minute time frame. Now remember, we set a volume profile, we have price, we have time and we have volume. As you can see on the right we have prices, in the middle with the horizontal bars that is the volume traded at each price and then we have the individual letters. Let's now look at the individual parts of the volume profile. The open price is represented with a big O. This is where the trading session begins. The times for the individual markets vary, so do be aware. We then have the close. The close is represented with a star. Now do note again, closes vary depending on which market you trade. This star will be continuously moving throughout the day as the market trades and will only The next metric is the high of the day. As you can see, the high is at the TPO or the letter that trades at the highest price of the session. And then the low of the day. The low is the lowest traded price on the day in that session, in that time frame. We then have the initial balance range the initial balance is the first hour of any trading session Now this depends again in Europe this can be from 7 to 8 a.m In the u.s. This can be from from the overnight session from 11 to 12 p.m. So it all depends on which market you're trading Do note, depending on which market you're trading, you should know the opening and closing hours as this will obviously adjust your charts according to the timeframes. So the initial balance is represented with this long blue bar and that is the first hour of trade or where the first hour of trade is contained. We then have the cash range. The cash range traditionally is the first hour of trade once the cash begins.", "transcript": "Now that we've dealt with each one of the individual metrics, let's see what they look like in a volume profile and where you can find them.

The cash range traditionally is the first hour of trade once the cash begins. Now again, in the European session the cash trade tends to open an hour after the futures open. In the US this is very different, so again note the time differences. If you're unsure you can find out more information on either the CME website, the Eurex website or the Life website. We then have the volume value area. Now the volume value area is the point where 70% of the day's volume is transacted. Now note on this chart I've colored it in a purple color. This is so it's easily identifiable where 70% of the day's range or the 70% of the day's volume is transacted or within which range is that volume transacted. Now, single prints is where there is only a single TPO or a single letter that is represented on the chart. The reason we highlight these single prints is a lot of the time these single prints can tell us a lot about what's going on within the auction process. We will discuss this a little bit further on, but do note, single prints can be highly important and that is why we mention them. high-volume node and the low-volume node. A high-volume node is where a lot of volume is transacted at one price or a number of prices, which would be called a high-volume area, and a low-volume node is a single price where there is low-volume traded, or a low-volume area is a few prices where a low amount of volume is traded. Again, we will talk a lot more about these as we go further down the line, but it's important to know right now at one price, and a low volume node is where a low volume is traded at one price. We then have tails. Now a tail, as you can see, is also known here as a single print. However tail tells us something very significant. It tells us where a market auctions very quickly away from a specific area. Now we do highlight these tails very often in distributions because they're telling us when a market very quickly rejects a certain price. So a tail is nothing more than a few the low and the high of this volume profile. We then have the POC or the VPOC.
