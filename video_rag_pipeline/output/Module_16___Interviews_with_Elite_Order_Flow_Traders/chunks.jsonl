So then you might be wanting to hold it three, four, five ticks, six ticks in a thicker market, you might have to wait for it to just slowly clear those prices which will can take five minutes, six minutes, or if you're doing bigger longer-term trades I might hold stuff for two or three hours but those kind of structures I'm not really looking at the price ladder.
