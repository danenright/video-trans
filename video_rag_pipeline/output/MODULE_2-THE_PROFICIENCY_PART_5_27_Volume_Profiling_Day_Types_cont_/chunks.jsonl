The normal variation of a normal day is less dynamic and less specific. We tend to see an extension of the initial balance, just like we saw in the neutral As you can see, long term players wait for the opportune moment to enter and they don't necessarily do this at the opening of the market that we saw in the normal day. Now, the reason it's slightly less dynamic is because what we saw with the first two day types, when we have a normal day type, we know that there's a high probability that the market is going to spend the day within the initial range. When we have a neutral day, we know there's a high probability that the market's likely to extend on both sides of the initial range. Whereas with a normal variation day, we know there's a high probability for extension, So it's important that we wait for these bigger time frames to make their move before then placing our trade strategies. We note that the accepted value of the distribution or where fair value is accepted tends to look like a B or P shape. Remember we spoke about these being both short The P shape is indicative of short covering, and the B shape is indicative of long liquidation. We'll now talk about our next day type which will be a trend day type.", "transcript": "The normal variation is the third non-trend day type that you can expect to see.
