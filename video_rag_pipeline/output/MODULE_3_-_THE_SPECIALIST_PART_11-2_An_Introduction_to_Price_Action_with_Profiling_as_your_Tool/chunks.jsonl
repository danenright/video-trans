I hope you're starting to understand now what it takes to develop unique trade strategies and what's required in order to develop real edge as we spoke about back in module 1. So what we're going to talk about now in part 11 is we're going to start off and I'm going to introduce you to the concept of price action and hopefully you can understand why professional traders not only use volume profiles as their desired tool but why they then execute using price action and price ladders. So why do professional traders use price action? Now, traditionally the retail market would execute using things like CFDs and spread markets and maybe even some futures markets, but you're always effectively playing some form of spread or commission to the broker. Now as professional traders with access to the futures exchanges, we can effectively execute at the market price. Straight away, this means we're no longer paying spread, and that's one of the most important reasons why we execute at the market. Another very very important reason is for execution purposes. Remember what I said, every single price and increment is crucial in trading. The difference between the price can mean so much in the big picture. Also when it comes to very specific trade strategies and you're executing with all sorts of algorithms as well as other professionals, speed is essential so we need to have access to the actual market and more importantly very quickly and efficiently. These are some of the main reasons why we use price ladder as a desired tool for execution. There are other reasons and those can be that you can develop very specific strategies just utilizing and watching the interaction between buyers and sellers. As you'll see in the coming example, the price ladder effectively shows us the real volume that buyers and sellers are transacting with one another. So by watching this real volume transacting, you can pick up on some early clues as to who's stronger, what the buyer's doing, whether he's stopping out or initiating new business. the price ladder and ultimately this will allow you with your strategies to almost perfect what you're trying to achieve. Now price action is objective and factual just like volume profiling so like we said that you know we want to be as objective as possible in terms of our strategies we also you know that the price ladder is as objective as can be why because what you see is what's physically occurring in the marketplace", "transcript": "Welcome back to part 11 guys and again I hope you really enjoyed those strategies we spoke about in part 10.

You learn to develop intuition as to how the price is responding. In momentum strategies, the market's going to respond very, very differently on the price ladder to say, reversal patterns, to say, just bracketing type markets. So all of this can be learned and taught using the price ladder. You should expect to see, in the example that we saw in the breakouts, we spoke about seeing a pickup in volatility and volume.
