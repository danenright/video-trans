The profile on the left is a profile that incorporates a traditional time value or time-based value area. The profile on the right is a modern day volume value area profile. As you can see, it's the exact same day type in the German Bunds. But what I want to illustrate to you is the main differences that you're going to see if you were to chop and change between the two. And that's why I said it's imperative that you decide for yourself what is the most important route for you to take. For me I would recommend to anyone to just use volume values going forward and however the decision is up to you and there is an argument for both cases however I feel the benefits and the logic behind using just time based value sorry using volume based value is far more important. So let's have a look at some of the key differences that you can see between the two distributions. It's quite obvious that profile what we can see is that the value area tends to be towards the lower end of the distribution on the day and the reason for that is the market spent the first half of the day towards the higher end of prices but it then sold off after hours so after 4 4 p.m when the cash markets had shut the market sold off and spent the rest of the evening distributing for five hours The question you have to ask yourself is, just because the market spent a long amount of time in the lower end of the distribution after hours, does that signify buyers and sellers willing to accept that price? That's the question you have to answer. Now if you look at the distribution on the right, you can see instead of utilizing time to determine the value error, we've used volume to determine value error. So we've said basically where buyers and sellers have agreed to 70% of the day's volume, that will be the value error for the day. So you can see the first major difference. Now again note in this instance the point of control obviously we would have that in a traditional value error, but In a volume base value, we will have a volume point of control. In this example, they are the same. The point of control in the left profile is the point where we had the most time frame TPO's traded, and the volume point of control on the right also happens to be the price It's very unusual to see them both at the same price, it does occur but it's more likely that they occur at different prices. So again, you need to decide from this day forward what would you prefer to use. I recommend using the volume point of control constantly so that I have a constant benchmark to lean against. The next thing is obviously the balance of distribution.", "transcript": "What you have in front of you is two profiles.
