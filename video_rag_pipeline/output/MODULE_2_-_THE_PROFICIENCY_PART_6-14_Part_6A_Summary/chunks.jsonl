We're going to talk firstly about bracketing and trending. We went through a couple of very, very nice examples. I showed you what we mean by bracketing and trending and how we move between bracketing and trending. So the first thing we're going to go through is what were the three types of ways or methods in which a market can move from bracketing to trending. And the first one we spoke about was a loss And what we spoke about here was where the market effectively just runs out of steam. So a graphic depiction, the market's moving sideways, moving sideways, we then start to break out, we distribute higher, distribute higher, distribute higher, and the market just runs out of momentum and starts to turn back over before then bracketing again. So effectively that was the first type of example we spoke about. initiative and runs into some strong type of responsive type price action and that we called effectively a V or an inverse V type pattern. This looked like on the chart where we would have a distribution, a little bit of bracketing, we then have an extension, extension, extension and a very quick reversal. Equally we could have it to the downside where we continue continue and have a relatively quick reversal That was our excess type example And then we moved on and we spoke about the most aggressive which is also a form of excess, but it includes volume volatility and very Excessive price so that was the major difference between excess and the major excess now the key that we identified with major excess example is that these tend to act as very good high and low swing points for some period of time. So when you see these excess tops made on volume volatility and excess prices they tend to hold for some time. And a good example to look at is particularly the gold when we shot above the 1900 level as well as the oil when it was trading around the $140 a barrel. Those are the two very strong examples you want to look at for excess type highs and lows in the market. We then moved on and we discussed the idea of volume and volatility and there were some very key points to look at in terms of volume and volatility. The key takeaway is remember, volume is a relative tool. High volume is very indicative of a lot of new business coming into the marketplace at various prices, whereas low volume is far more indicative of less sort of new business", "transcript": "So welcome to part 6a summary.

The key takeaway is remember, volume is a relative tool. High volume is very indicative of a lot of new business coming into the marketplace at various prices, whereas low volume is far more indicative of less sort of new business and maybe a lot more sort of passive type trade. So it's a wonderful relative tool and we went through a lot of key understandings of why we use volume in developing our various strategies as well as obviously volatility. not necessarily imply liquidity. Volatility does not necessarily imply more volume. Volatility just implies the market moving over a much bigger variance around the mean. So we distribute ourselves in a bigger type range than usual. Now let's discuss a unique trade strategy Now the strategy I'm going to show you is when we have a high volume breakout. So what this example would look like, and I'm going to combine it with a bracketing and trending example, is let's say for instance the market or the day has been distributing for some time. So the market is distributing, we're sitting inside the day's range, and we're auctioning We then take out a key area or a key reference point in the market which is the high of the distribution. Now, if we see a very large pickup in volume, so let's say on average over the course of the day we've been seeing lots and lots of little volume bars and all of a sudden we see almost three times or four times the volume being traded over a period of a session on the break. of this key reference point. That volume is a key identifier of new business that has come into the market. Now when that new business comes into the market, firstly we do not, rule number one, no fading. So we do not want to employ strategies that suggest we go against volume. So straight away, if you can employ a rule of thumb rule into your trading, which is to not go against high volume moves up or down, you're really going to sort of avoid a lot of pitfalls that a lot of traders make.
