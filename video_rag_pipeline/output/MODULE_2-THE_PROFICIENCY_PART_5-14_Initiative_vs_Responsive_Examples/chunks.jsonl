It's a breakout or an inside daybreak. It's a very popular sort of trade setup.

Then we're going to start developing a strategy so that you can take advantage of understanding these very basic but powerful and profitable strategies. So, what you can see is a very basic inside daybreak. We can see a little bit of momentum, a little bit of one-time framing coming into this market. But the key is that once we see the initiation, once we see that buy flow come into the market, note how it lasts the entire session. Had you stayed a buyer for predominantly this entire session, imagine how easy it would have felt. Now, I'm not saying you buy at the start of the day, what I'm saying is you're initiating or looking for long side trade opportunities only, and that's the purpose of distinguishing between sort of initiative and responsive price behavior. When we see very aggressive initiative price behavior, we don't want to be entertaining type price behavior. If we don't see that, the market is likely to keep trending or moving in a very aggressive way as we see the initiation occur over the period of the entire session. so important is that as a trader we always want to develop our edges or our strategies in line with the prevailing trend and that is why it's crucial to distinguish between initiative price response behavior and responsive price action.", "transcript": "Now, again, one last example of an initiative sort of price action response, and the example we've used here is like a breakout.
