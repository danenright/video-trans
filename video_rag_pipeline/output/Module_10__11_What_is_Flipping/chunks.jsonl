Once the market has been layered or falsely built So what we discussed in the previous slide. So again, once the market has been layered either on the buy side or the sell side or falsely built up Then the process of pulling all the orders that the spoof has artificially stacked on the order book Whilst the spoof has received the requested fills is called the flip So again, let me just explain that and we'll be looking at that in one of the videos a little bit later on in the modules when we analyze a particular pattern where we're putting a trading strategy around. Again so you're layering the order book, so in this instance say the spoofer and the flipper is layering the order book, making it look artificially strong, pulling Then what happens, it has some passive sell-side orders, gets filled on the sell-side order, so now his net's short, and then the moment he gets the requested fill, he pulls all of his buy orders, the market flips downwards, and then he gets out of those orders and he profits from that activity, and that is what you call a classic flip, and you'll be looking at that later on in one of our latter video analysis.", "transcript": "So what is flipping?
