This is strategy two, hiding behind the elephant. In terms of the product, we're looking at the oil. Do note, obviously this example was utilized within the unit session, which was unit seven. So we're going to go through it again. I'm going to just take you through the nitty-gritty of it, point out a few other things and hopefully then you'll really understand and grasp the trade strategy So the first thing obviously is to look at context, we can see again dealt on the day. Mine is 10,650, and we can also see quite a negative delta forming on the current last two rotations. Note the volume, nice dark blue showing us relatively large volume on these rotations. Do bear in mind these are five minute rotations. With that being said, we can see the elephant forming here. It stands out very clearly. We can see it not just as very dark colors, but we can also see it as very large numbers. Okay, so those three prices there, 80, 81, 82. Compare the numbers there, we're looking at 2062, I mean the next closest bed absorb that we've got is maybe 500, we've got a 600 there, so a really large chunky amount of volume being transacted, being absorbed at 80, 81, 82. So that's our elephant in effect forming. Now note, we spoke about when we do have the elephant forming, we need to wait for a close of the rotation, for a little test or a little pop below. Once it goes back a bit above the elephant, we want to look to execute. So right now we still have our elephant being formed. We would need to wait for that next rotation. Just a couple of factors, note the imbalance, so we can see a very light volume, a great deal of imbalances there were around 85, 86, 87. So again in terms of target, we always want to look for natural targets for these elephants. Do bear in mind to the upside we also have got a number of low volume area, also sets of single prints there, maybe some stops with the zeros, or an imbalance in effect. So we've got an imbalance, low volume area, which can be a very very nice target for the elephant trade strategy. So that being said, let's then roll the tape a little bit forward, let's get to that point of the next rotation, and then we can see. Okay, so the next rotation comes in, now what we're looking for is we're looking for absorption in and around the elephant.

We want to see a little extension below our elephant before we execute once it gets back above the elephant. Now again, there's two ways to do this. see the test the elephant here. Some traders do tend to get stuck in already here. That makes perfect sense. It's a little bit preemptive, but you know that you're in. So you'd be getting filled there, 81 bid. You now bid the market and you would have a stop below with a target somewhere around the fill of that little imbalance up at the top, it's double O's. So we're looking at a good 20 tick winner for a 6 tick stop, very very nice risk reward metrics. So that being said, note the absorption, quite a lot of absorption here, 80, 81, quite a lot being transacted here, really really good price action sign, really good interaction that you're seeing here. There we go below the elephant. So the second variation or the methodology to trade is to wait once we get back above that elephant. So we're looking for the market to get back above 81s. Now the reason some people do wait for the elephant or wait for it to get back above is because that confirms there is more liquidity to be taken by Again, what I would say, this isn't an ideal elephant, very rarely will you see this much volume being transacted below the elephant, more often it's a case of we trade below it and straight back above it. That's normally how we would see the elephant trading out. That being said, obviously we're now back at those 79s, if we were to get back into for a long trade again this time stop below the low as soon as we start to move on sides we can then obviously rotate that stop to just below that elephant so again waiting does have its advantage which is that ultimately you get to use a slightly tighter stop okay so we're now looking to get long we've got our bids at 80 81 looking for a fill Ultimately, we've currently got a stop around those 74s. As the next rotation comes in and we start to drift a little bit higher, we'll rotate that stop to just below that elephant, which would be... price point 79. Again, you're talking about a 2 tick stop versus a 6 tick stop. If you preempt, you definitely will be in and you will be able to take advantage. If you don't preempt, you might miss it, but that being said, you obviously do get the advantage of a much tighter stop. So it all depends guys, in terms of how you execute, all depends.

We've now got our fill at 80.81s and we can see there our next rotation comes in. Again the market comes down. Notice where it's testing, 80.81, 82. That's our elephant. Again, now if you are in 80-80 ones, you can start to look to move that stop once we take out those 85s. So once we clear those 85s, you can lift your stop a little bit higher and manage that risk. You don't always have to keep a stop static, you have to keep a stop where it makes the trade invalid. So this elephant is very much still a valid trade, but if we start to move higher and we can obviously reduce that risk as the trade is starting to work in our favor. Okay so we can see again we're just rotating within the range and suddenly the market takes out the higher end of the previous rotation. Now at this point we'll shift that stop up from 75's, bring it into 79's almost at scratch. So a really, really powerful position to be in. Whenever you have a trade where effectively you get a free trade, in a sense where the risk is either zero or very marginal, that's a fantastically powerful position to be in. But do note you have to work for that position. You have to really work really focusing on your risk in order to get that effective free trade. We said one of two things in terms of target. We either look for a logical target i.e. Maybe a fill of this imbalance up at the top here or secondary We're looking for the market to tell us when to get out. That's again There's too many people asking that question. Where should I get out? Okay, you get out where the trade Has effectively done what it should do now remember hiding behind the elephant trade is very much a scalp trade Okay, so we're not looking to be too smart. So we're just looking to take advantage of a price action phenomenon within the price footprint chart. So that being said, obviously we would like to get up to this target and let's see what happens now. We can see at the end of this rotation, the market continues to drift higher, we've now got a stop at 79 and we can see the market just continues this process of drifting slightly higher and higher.

We can see that this market has now done a series of three higher lows. So again, whilst we're managing our target, looking for somewhere around those 56 double lows, if we don't get there, we don't want to be getting hit on a full stop. effectively meaning that regardless the outcome of the trade we will finish in the money. Ok, the market then comes down in the next rotation and what we're going to see now is ourselves effectively being stopped out of this trade. Ok, so the market comes down, note, it takes out the previous low rotation. Now again it's so important, you know we would have shifted that stop again a little bit higher. we would have been stopped at 87 to lock in a 6 tick winner by no means going to break the bank with a 6 tick winner, but it's a 6 tick winner nonetheless. That's why we manage risk. If you do this trade over the course of a year and you do it say 20, 30 times and you're taking in 6 ticks every time, you're looking at a 180 tick winner. Now on the smallest increment of $10, that's $1,800 for a very quick, relatively straightforward Okay, so you can understand the power of obviously managing the trade, managing the risk, managing the targets. Now, just two other things I want to point out that are very interesting in this video. Do note, when we come back down to 80, 81 and 82, this is effectively where the market tests. Okay, so we can see the market comes back down again, tests that elephant and straight away springboards and we start to move higher again. Okay, so very very interesting, you know, what I'm trying to point out here is the concept that markets have got memory, okay, they don't forget these very key price points easily, so do factor that in, you know, the markets can hold those price points time and time and time again. Okay, the market then rotates higher and we continue to move up the page towards that imbalance. Okay guys, I don't want to go too much more through it, obviously we've seen the full extent of that video. In terms of some of the metrics, there's nothing really too much important to point out. Okay, so again, a couple of telltale signs for taking profit. We could see that real dark blue.
