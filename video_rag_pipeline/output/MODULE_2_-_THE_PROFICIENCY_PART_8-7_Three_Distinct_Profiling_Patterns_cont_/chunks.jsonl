Now long liquidation or the B shape profile usually occurs when we get an overextended rally. So the market doesn't accept any value on the way high and we get very little balance. As a result, what occurs is we get some very bad, or some very aggressive buying into very, very high and premium prices, and all of a sudden that initiates, or that gets a response from longer term sellers. And what then occurs is we get an aggressive sell side response, and what sort of makes the move very aggressive, and the reversal very aggressive, is that anyone who bought aggressively and got long too high up will then liquidate those longs and be forced out of those long positions resulting in quite an aggressive looking reversal type move. Now Important to note, the market will continue to filter lower until it runs into longer term responsive buyers. Now note again, as we said in the P shape, the B shape is highly likely that high gets revisited and retested at some point in the future. So again, the high probability trade is to wait for the market to sell off to such a point that responsive buyers are brought back into the game. We then look to buy with those responsive buyers for a move up toward higher prices. Now let's turn our attention to the chalkboard and look how we can develop some strategies", "transcript": "This pattern is almost the exact opposite of the P profile that we spoke about.
