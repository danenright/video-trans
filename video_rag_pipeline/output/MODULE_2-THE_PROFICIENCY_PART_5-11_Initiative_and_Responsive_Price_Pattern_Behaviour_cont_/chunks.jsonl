In fact, responsive is where the buyers and sellers respond to higher or lower prices being advertised. Now, a good example to look at is the one in the chart provided. As you can see, at the high where we have resistance, when the market gets to those from sellers. In other words, sellers get brought into the game or they respond to the higher prices. Equally, when the price is advertised toward the support area, we again see buyers responding to lower prices being advertised. Now on the flip side, remember, we said initiative is very aggressive. The order type is very aggressive at the market, not as passive. So what we can see now is that responsive passive order type. So in a downward pricing initiative taken by sellers, there are buyers resting on the bid at lower prices passively waiting to be brought into the game. So as prices start to move lower because sellers are initiating sell side orders, there will be buyers sitting on the bid waiting or happily getting filled at lower prices being advertised. So they're passively The typically when we see responsive buying or selling Two-way trade occurs and the market moves sideways, finding some accepted fair value. So what you will come to notice, and you should have already noticed, is that most of the time in the markets over a period of a day, most of the time is spent with responsive type price action. It's very, very rare, you know, that most days you'll find that there's one or two initiative moves in the market, and then the rest of the day we spend kind of just passively responding as prices move up and down. Now initiative and responsive price action are two types of auction process that occur over a multitude of timeframes. In order to fully grasp the concept, you should also apply it to your preferred timeframe. one minute or a two minute or a ten minute, a half hour, hourly, daily, you can utilize the concept of initiative versus responsive on any given time frame. The important thing very important principle and start applying it to some of your thinking when you are looking at the markets. You do that and suddenly you're just going to suddenly start looking at the markets very very differently.", "transcript": "So, responsive price action is not as aggressive as initiative price action.
