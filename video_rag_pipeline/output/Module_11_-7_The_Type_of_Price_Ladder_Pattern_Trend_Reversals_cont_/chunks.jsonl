Now the importance is again the personality change and after a trend move the first sign of a potential trend reversal or temporary halting of the trend, depending on the time frame you're looking at, you could have a daily breakout move but you're hitting an hourly play even though at the end of the day might trade lower but during that hour you're able to actually find a little bit of a relief rally if the markets been selling off and the converse is true towards the upside and really what you're trying to observe the personality change on and let me just make this very trying very clear for those of you trading the ladder there's normally one type of auctioning activity that goes when a market is moving in a direction. So as the market starts moving in direction it participates in a certain type of auctioning speed and whilst it is auctioning at a certain speed and activity level it reaches a point where all of a sudden that auctioning activity or a new flipper comes into the market or new type of activity changes or auction paths with a person eight year and that's a lot of times the subtle first clue that the market has shifted. the way it moved, and the moment it shifted the way it moved, it's your first little subtle clue that that trend might not hold. So if you are trading the direction of that trend, now it's time to either scale out your position or potentially on a smaller time frame look for some reversal plays if all of a sudden you see an absorber coming to the market or a distributor coming to the market or a flipper coming to the market and a lot of those times it's that new personality shift that gives you that first indication. So again let me just explain that is that the market will move in a direction on a uniform, almost a uniformed way, or uniform way of activity and auctioning speed. But once that uniformed way kind of almost changes its personality, that's your first signal to start liquidating a pre-existing position or start getting into a new position. So really, really important on how you try and observe that. But that... takes a lot of dedicated practice and observation when you're watching the market. So the personality change can take a form of any combination of order flow patterns learned in this program so, you know from absorption to flip-type plays to spoofing patterns and Whilst you observe all of those little subtleties you were able to you know As your eye becomes more climatized to the price ladder You're able to execute the right as strategies accordingly the key is to quickly observe that change and then adapt your execution Size management strategy appropriately. And so as you notice the change do you liquidating most of your size quite quickly, do you liquidate, do you take some of the table or you start cutting and reversing your position.
