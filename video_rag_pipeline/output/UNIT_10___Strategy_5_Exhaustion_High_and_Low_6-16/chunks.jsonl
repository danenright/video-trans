Okay so if ever you see zeros at an extreme that tells you that we've run into an exhaustion high. Why? Zeros signify to us that ultimately we have got a very aggressive um in this case obviously buyer okay so this will be at a buyer extreme and ultimately the market's been going up and someone short has just decided And I've hit the market for all of these contracts.

Yeah. Okay. So again an example of going up. Maybe there's some P. You're gonna see 3,000 maybe 500 2,500 maybe 1,000 and 600 Okay 4,000 okay, and maybe So again we can see the imbalance, a real aggressive amount of buying, but note in this example the buying, the aggressive buying is being met by what? Liquidity. So in the two examples above, liquidity is at a premium, therefore it either shows zeros which are stops, or it shows the imbalance with low volume. If there's high volume or high liquidity being provided, you will see a high volume imbalance at the extreme. So these are the three variations of an exhaustion high or low that you can expect to see. Now note, one of the other ones, but again this is something you can look into, is when we get delta divergences. Again as I showed you in unit four, when we spoke about the concept of bars, a bar chart for the I showed you that if all of a sudden prices are going higher, but the delta is actually going in the opposite direction, then in effect we are approaching an exhaustion high or low. Now note, so important, is in the example of a divergence of the delta bars, you're Because what occurs here when someone's providing liquidity is not only are they responding to the high prices but they're equally selling a lot into the best bid. Okay so in effect there is more selling taking place at the best bid than there is buying occurring. Okay that's why sometimes with these delta divergences you'll most likely see them with the example of the So those are the examples where you can expect to see an exhaustion higher low.

OK, we're looking for an imbalance. And that imbalance can be high or low volume. Or we're looking for a delta divergence. If you see one of those, it's very simple. Step one, what I am going to say to you is fading can be dangerous, it can be quite difficult as well. So what I'm going to suggest, as you'll see in the examples, if you are going to fade, let the market ping at the high, let it go off it and when it comes back, sell it there. Don't sell it on the way down, otherwise you're increasing your risk. So that's your first option to fade on a retest high. Your second option is to buy the first pullback and this is probably the highest probability opportunity. So once it pulls back and we see the absorption we simply get long looking for that little bounce and our third, oh actually sorry, those are the only opportunities okay. So it's first and foremost the fade but the highest probability is to buy that first let's just establish why the markets take a break. I know we went over this in unit three but just to understand why the markets take that break. Okay it's simple one is profit taking okay and two is mean reversion. In other words when a market does overextend there are algorithms that are created to fade a market when we have reached a point that is a bit too extreme. Okay as a third trade opportunity, okay? This is probably the most difficult, however, is that very often, in the example of a high volume imbalance, okay? We're gonna leave a bad high or a bad low. In which case, once the break is over, the markets may be pulled back. Once it starts to move higher again, it gives the kind of clues you need.

But when a market shows an exhaustion high or low, like I've just showed you and like I'm going to show you in examples, that for me is the high probability or ultimately look for a potential fade opportunity. Okay now let's go and have a look at some of the examples and we can see what this looks like on the footprint. So first example note we always start off with pre-context okay we can see the imbalance quite a strong imbalance quite a lot of stops the market then has a little bit of absorption but a response of buying and suddenly the market runs into High relative volume high relative Delta high cumulative Delta. Okay, so we've got the trend phase one phase two we're looking for Effectively the signal so we're looking for the signal which comes in three versions stops in balance Delta divergence Okay, once those stops are in like I said We won't necessarily be able to get any of these prices We're looking for the absorption before we buy the market and target a little bit of a bounce Note, like I said, on the bounce, you're looking for absorption before entering shorts. Now this example, note, it came and tested one of the high volume areas that we left previously but it didn't really give an absorption before offering lower. So it didn't really give us a short side opportunity but definitely gave us the opportunity to be long for a little bounce before then taking out and continuing lower. Now note what I would say on the continuation example. Be very cautious Okay, simple reason is that when a markets overextended it's overdone. It's it's oversold in this example To continue trending to continue initiating is going to require some influential participants to continue to be aggressive Now it's not to say they can't of course they can but very often Strong participants are going to allow the market or they're going to allow the opportunity to find some liquidity Before they then continue in other words When we sell off and I'll talk a little bit about this in the initiative strategy When we bounce ultimately the sellers are going to back off okay? Why because they've run into liquidity Okay, so if you're a big seller and you need to get an order done You're not going to keep selling if someone's providing liquidity And that's why we get the bounce then the sellers step back in if the liquidity is there they back off again", "transcript": "Once it starts to move higher again, it gives the kind of clues you need. You then wanna be looking for the extension and continuation. Now note the tip. Exhaustion highs and lows are a better way to time the fading markets or taking profits. In other words, you can keep using some of the approaches you have to fading a market. But when a market shows an exhaustion high or low, like I've just showed you and like I'm going to show you in examples, that for me is the high probability or ultimately look for a potential fade opportunity. Okay now let's go and have a look at some of the examples and we can see what this looks like on the footprint. So first example note we always start off with pre-context okay we can see the imbalance quite a strong imbalance quite a lot of stops the market then has a little bit of absorption but a response of buying and suddenly the market runs into High relative volume high relative Delta high cumulative Delta. Okay, so we've got the trend phase one phase two we're looking for Effectively the signal so we're looking for the signal which comes in three versions stops in balance Delta divergence Okay, once those stops are in like I said We won't necessarily be able to get any of these prices We're looking for the absorption before we buy the market and target a little bit of a bounce Note, like I said, on the bounce, you're looking for absorption before entering shorts.

Okay, so you can see it breaks down. There's still liquidity being provided. Quite a lot of passive buyers sitting there and ultimately we can see them getting hit and the market rotates higher again. Okay, so just be aware of that. The most profitable strategy is obviously the first pullback and obviously if you can get a little bit of a fade opportunity on that could be also potentially profitable. Okay, let's now have a look at another example. Okay, so again this is a little bit of a stronger example again instead of the stopouts now we're going to see the imbalance at the high. So again note the trend-like move nice green candle as you can see full-bodied candle absorption at the low before continuation some absorption higher continuation absorption higher. So the buyer is real intentional here see the Delta picking up you can see a nice positive Delta on the day also high relative volume. Okay, this is obviously the Euro dollar five minute time frame from the 20th of December. Now note, obviously, the market then creates a double imbalance, some absorption before creating an imbalanced high. Okay, when we see that imbalanced high, we're looking for short side trades. Okay, we're also looking to buy the first pullback on absorption. Okay, so again, this is a five minute time frame, probably would have been slightly easier to see on a rotational time frame, but in essence, that's where you want to be buying. Ultimately, this was quite a strong reversal, a lot of you should be looking at this and saying this was quite a good inverse V reversal. We can see obviously the passive buyers stepping in, holding the market bid, once they got token out, notice the absorption below, before the extension down and the delta pickup. obviously the market rotated all the way in the opposite direction. Okay so again what I would say again in terms of risk management how we prevent ourselves from getting caught in this it's simple. Okay once we're executing there on the absorption we simply want to be looking for a retest of the highs. Okay I'll stop right behind there. Why? Well it's simple we're buying on the fact that buyers should be defending this breakout If they're not defending it and suddenly they start to become overwhelmed, we're simply stopping out for a relatively tight stop. Okay another example is the oil market.

Okay guys let's now move So the good news is you don't have to be a golfer to appreciate this book. Golf is not a game of perfect, Dr Barbara Teller is ultimately a sports psychologist, been around a long, long time and what I really like about this book, obviously if you have played golf or you understand the game of golf... It will, you'll be able to relate quite a lot which will make you appreciate it a lot more. But the principles remain the same, whether it's golf, whether it's trading, there's so many similarities between the two now. Obviously in terms of actions, you might want to start playing golf. But ultimately this is a book all about mental understanding and preparation. It's a fantastic book in terms of the highlights. It's a story like narrative encompassing troubles faced in the golf game with practical What I really like about this book, it goes through all the mental hurdles, the mental barriers that a professional golfer would have. Now why it's so brilliant is that all those same hurdles, the exact same hurdles you have as a trader, things like routine, things like practicing, things like when you step into the markets and suddenly things don't quite go according to plan, things like when you're having a bad day and you somehow have to just maintain face. All of these elements are contained in this book and that's why it's a brilliant read. Some of the other highlights Golf is a game of controlling what you can by understanding what can be controlled I think this is this is the real key takeaway of this book. Okay Trading you can only control so much. Okay. Most people don't realize it most people Seem to think you can control the outcomes Unfortunately, you cannot you can only control certain elements of your game and that's what this book will highlight You know, it'll teach you to identify what? can you control and when you know what you can control make damn sure that you control that 100% to the best of your ability because everything else is out of your control. Okay, obviously then how to keep your emotions and thought focus on what matters again something that's so relevant to us as traders and lastly practical techniques to overcome some of these difficulties and this is the part I really like again gives you a few ideas you know if you're someone you know that maybe struggles once you start having a bad run well how are you going to practically Okay great book, definitely read very short and if you're a golfer you'll definitely love it.", "transcript": "than we should be.
