And this is especially true of markets prone to the no pullback breakouts. And what does that mean, no pullback? That's exactly what I meant by locking the door behind them. This is a very common feature of funds, annoyingly a lot of the time, and treasuries. Oftentimes they will break out, hold one price, two prices, continue. Hold the next price two prices and then continue. Okay Consider that retracement depth of maximum two three takes versus the retracement depth You often have in the pullback of oil where in oil or S&P you break out to mine and trace either the majority to move or allow them to move before continuing Very often if there's large, you know But if there's volatility if there's reason for thicker markets to move like ones like US Treasuries They will just absolutely not pull back at the same time.

It seemed like, you know, a very aggressive offering, very little chance of pullbacks really, and apart from a few here, you know, the thicker markets, the short-end the lows.

And this is where observing the ladder at the same time is very useful because this exchange, this pace, this activity between, you know, the reloading price is very aggressive.

And here we started getting picked up and found decent buyers. And essentially, this is the structure we're just formed with. We have a decent range, and we're very quickly looking at this high here at 99s All this buying will actually bring in more new business and we're going to continue auctioning higher. And what has happened and what made this trade nicer, let's say, or this positioning is the fact that you have all the short positioning, but at the same time as the days start to mature is that all the risk on flow we had, all the bid we had in equities coming higher is in fact starting to turn. And then for example, your stocks at this time are starting to turn and coming off And as the equity started to trade lower, you know, we trade high in the morning, we trade lower, and now the bonds are literally in the mirror image and, you know, bidding on that, on equities coming off. And what this does is we are very, very ripe for a squeeze, to squeeze out all the people who have been, you know, participating in this range and to break above 99, so to really, you know, rip through. And again, here's a bit more understanding of the meta game, imagining your traders Imagine the pressure on you. Okay, you know, you're short here. Perhaps quite involved more down here You try to perhaps shortly get these low and then the session is very very choppy You've probably given this more, you know risk than you should have in the market keeps pressure pressuring and you could really imagine that You know the last sort of Willpower stay in would be this 99 holding if that doesn't then you call hell will break loose and then a lot of the shorts Will be capitulating Okay. So now we're gonna look at the footprint that will happen in terms of an example of an absorption rule when we actually broke through this 99th level, but before we do that, I'm just going to mention something very quickly. There is an issue when you look back through your chart historically on a split view, a split bid and ask view on this kind of footprint chart, because you need to watch this kind of trade in real time. What will happen is, for example, is the fact that the market will trade higher, if you don't notice this kind of activity around then it might just come off a bit and feel the few few ticks behind it it will show a lot of this sort of staggeredness you know that that's sort of the big the big box you're trying to you know look at the sort of you know the sore thumb sticking out eventually that will get traded through and get evened out so it won't be very obvious to you when you're looking back through your chart that this actually happened okay and", "transcript": "they'd be trapped and the market comes off.

There's no further continuation great trading a great example nonetheless of where you'd enter stop and conversely showing you why desktop is actually in a very good place as we'll go through the video. Okay so again this is what we're going to look at the footprint frame by frame so here we have 99s and you can see first of all great what happens there's a reloading here the sellers have been trying to sell engine already a thousand lot and he's just taking out one price Okay, so you're already picking up you're observing this as we do it and what happens next we trade higher Okay, so that reloading came here and you can see that was actually the end of it very quickly We traded we even skipped one price.

Very simply what you want to do is once you've identified all of these conditions is very simply to get filled with a limit to join this reloader.

You should have a very tight stop. And again, just like the zeroes trade, you're trying to go for a binary scenario.
