Now, before we actually move on to the strategy, let's just discuss first and foremost what we mean by the initial balance. Now, initial balance can also be referred to as the initial period. So it's the period before the cash market or at least the more influential market moving If we take the four examples of the markets we used, the oil would be between roughly 11 and 2pm, the E-Money S&P will be between roughly 11pm and 2.30pm, the Eurodollar FX then the German buns will be between 7 and 8 a.m. Now as you can see it's not the initial period or the initial balance shouldn't be an exact definition it should more be the period during which you know, those influential participants are not there. So it may vary, you might find that for a period of six months or a year that the oil tends to see very influential participants start coming in earlier than you expect. Make sure you just adjust according to that. Now once you've established and understood what we mean by the initial balance or the initial period, we then need to talk about what we mean by the definition of The wide is very much a relative term that we use. Now what I want you to understand is that, the important thing to understand is that if on a day-to-day basis, one of the things I would use for this is a moving average of the daily range. Now let's take for example that the e-money S&Ps currently the average daily range All of a sudden, you come in, the cash session is about to open, and we find that the overnight initial period is actually maybe 15 handles. So substantially larger than what the average daily range of the E-mini S&P is.

So in a basic drawing, once we see that very wide range, the market is likely to do one of three things. is a full-scale volatile distribution. So what we mean by that is that the market will open and range within that range for most of the day, but it will do it in a volatile manner. and the reason is simple. When we get such a wide range initially, what tends to happen is you tend to get a lot of almost false momentum. So players will be looking to short at lows, looking for continuation, and they then get trapped and need to reverse. Equally, we'll get players trapped into the highs looking for failed momentum. and then they all need to reverse and that's what creates almost what looks like momentum but the momentum is not necessarily in a break out manner but rather within a distribution and that is why we've added this to our series of momentum plays. These plays, that's the first sort of type of example that you'd find, but these momentum plays can be particularly lucrative, but they do require you to first and foremost identify when the strategy is in play. Now the other two typical patterns you can expect to see is where, again, we have a wide balance, but this time round, however, the marker tends to distribute in a much smaller range toward the upside, and in the second example, a much smaller range downside. Now what we're going to do is we're going to look at the example where we have a volatile distribution throughout the entire day's range. So I can show you guys how quickly the market can move from high to low and low to high and show you that in this instance if you identify the strategy early enough the risk reward is there to fade the failed perceived momentum. So let's go through the play and see what it looks like over the course of the So as you can see in this example, just to pay some context, the average daily range was roughly 70 ticks and as you can see, the market comes in, we trade from 160.60 all the way down to the 159.75. So let's just go back a brief moment and have a look how the market played out from the start. So the market opens up, we very aggressively move down within the first hour of trade.

So it's almost like we get a lot of shorts entering short below that 159.90, looking for a continuation of this perceived initiative or this perceived momentum.

So straight away, if you can pick up on this and identify it, you will notice there should be some short positioning from short-term participants in the market at that $159.90. how quickly the market gets back above that $159.90. So let's replay. We can see the cash opens, cash comes in. We see a little bit of aggression in the cash market. Cash market takes out the initial balance low, bang, bang, bang. We start to see the market go up again. So within the same half hour period, the cash takes out the initial balance low and makes a new low on the day, but most important, where does it close? Bang, closes back inside the initial balance. Our first early clue, the fact that we close back inside the initial balance. Now notice how quickly, once the market closes back inside the initial balance, how quickly we get that imprint scrambling toward the upside. Firstly, the shorts need to unwind, but more importantly, we're starting to see fresh buyers enter the market.

In terms of if we're buying in and around these lows, it's going to cost you a stop out somewhere below that low.

Because, like I said, the market is volatile once it re-enters. It's volatile once it turns. So you have to hit at the market. You don't want to be passive in In terms of management, well it's simple, we need to have the belief and the understanding that once we execute, we are getting the desired reward for the risk we're taking on.
