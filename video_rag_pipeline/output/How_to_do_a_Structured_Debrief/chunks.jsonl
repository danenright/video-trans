I think that's the surprise for all of you. It's a good point in the year to go through a debrief with you, to really show you the nitty-gritty nuances of what is in my debrief, what I look at at the end of the day, and the reasons behind why I do it the way I do it. You're gonna see a lot of structure to this debrief, a lot of consistency to this debrief, and these are some of the real key elements required to ultimately get the real benefits out. of a debrief. That being said, first and foremost, what is the point of a debrief? It's simple, it comes down to one word, thought. A debrief is nothing more than thought. It's a collection of thought. It allows you to rethink some of the processes, some of the things you did during the course of the session. That thought, ultimately, when you go through it, you can then make adjustments to that thought, you can really add some value to that thought, and then begin the process of cognitive memorizing, of really sort of reinforcing those thoughts that you can draw upon at a future date. That is why we do a debrief, that is the whole purpose of me doing a debrief with you. Just make sure, you know, something that's crucially important, don't make the mistake, and I know because I've made this mistake, don't make the mistake in thinking that listening to me or a Nick or a, you know, whoever might be doing a reg, maybe doing a debrief, Don't think that that ultimately covers you for a debrief. It doesn't, ok? You listening to me now is a lesson and that is why these debriefs should try and make them only twenty minutes long because that's long enough for you to learn a lesson that you can ultimately then go and apply. Okay, so that being said, let's do a debrief. Let's do it together. I'm going to go through the method in the madness. Remember, most important, don't take my debrief and just suddenly duplicate it, alright? This debrief is very personalized to me based on what I feel is working, what isn't working and how I can adjust it. Okay, so my debrief It's a very simple debrief, I'm going to take you through it using Evernote, there's no secret, pretty much our entire firm uses Evernote for good reason, it's a very easy management tool, you can use Microsoft Word, you can use a piece of paper, it doesn't matter what you use, so long as you actually create a consistent process. So the first thing you're going to do, and this is where it all starts, we observe the day. So you want to go and observe the day, write the day down, go write down everything You know, that, that, that... structure the day. Was there a lot of data? Was it an economic light data? Was there volatility out of Asia? Was there, you know, really little flow in the morning session, a lot of flow in the afternoon?

Okay, now I'm not even going to pretend to fill out these other markets at the moment because I haven't done a great deal of trading today or yesterday or the day before that, so again I've briefly looked at the bonds today, so I could see there was no real flow in it, no real volume and no real initiative, so I go and type Once I've observed all the markets I've traded, I then want to move into my individual trade opportunities. Now, we've got two categories with regards to trade opportunities. We've got one which are predetermined.

So it's all good and well, we're writing out things, characterizing them, but then we have to go into the real nitty-gritty of the trade strategy.

We know what the structure is, we know our entry points, our exit points, we know everything about this trade strategy. is we're going to go now and we would create, ultimately, a template.

So we're going to our trade strategies and again, I don't want to, this is not an ever note debriefing, strategy called oil and we would say day two failed extension and oil okay now begins the fun part so now what we do is we actually go into the physical charting aspect okay so we get our charts up like you know you would normally do this is how the guys would normally conduct a debrief and we go into every single aspect of this trade strategy.

Single prints, single prints, low volume areas, lots of low volume areas, no real defined distribution on the day, an open at the lower, close on the high, all key characteristics of a trend. So step one is identify the trade strategy. I observed ultimately the trend was there and that there was the potential for a day two failed extension. Okay, now we came in this morning and I'm going to just split We came in this morning, we had two definable distributions in the range, and we spoke about this little ledge, and we hinted that any failure to break that ledge and hold the break... We'd be looking for some short side trades to target a fill or at first a re-entry of price But then a fill of these single prints down towards that 88 90 area so that was our play that was our general strategy and Then we go into the nitty-gritty of it. So what we want to do now Let's get that sheet up so I can sort of do it next to you and I'm going to do this on the side And I really hope guys you I hope you Following along here as I'm going through in this debrief. Okay, so step one we identified and again We go and put a little picture there annotate the picture color the picture do what you need to do So that you don't forget the key pair, you know parameters of a trend day Okay, so once you've identified or sorry once you've observed the trend day observed We then identified our trade strategy And our trade strategy, we're going to call it day to trend failure. And then we go and characterize it, so again, ultimately we know what the principal strategy is. Ultimately once it gets back below those 16s, sorry, once it gets back inside that in its range below 17s, we're looking for a sell-side trade to target single prints. That is the trade but that's not good enough alright. What we have to go and do now is find ourselves our access point, so how we get in, and our profit take. Now for that, we're going to zoom in a little bit more, we're going to have a look at some different charts. So let's get on a little bit of a five minute chart, and let's get up to the oil. Bear with me a second. So yeah, we have it. So we can see very early We have the little extension there. I'm going to put a nice little line, add the extension, came back, notice we tested that extension again, came below it and then utilized those 17s which turned support into a little bit of resistance.

That's the juicy movie we're after, targeting the full of the single prints. So now it's important that we go and we again try and capture as much of the information as we can. Okay, again we go and highlight anything we can that ultimately acts as an observation. So we can see ultimately we tested the 17s, retested the 17s. We can see then the market formed a little bit of a base around these 13s, gave us an entry point around those 13s. We had quite a bit of sideways consolidation before we ultimately got to move low.

Now, if I spend the time observing, identifying, and looking at all the parameters around this trade strategy, then guess what? The next time it comes up, I simply have to come back to this document, observe the key access points. This is the real nuances. Anyone can find a trade strategy. Anyone can say this is going to go up or down. That's not the hard part. The hard part is the execution. How do I get in minimizing risk, maximizing reward? That's what these access points are about. two very identifiable access points. If that happens again in the future, guess what? You're going to execute more confidently, more aggressively and you're going to make more money. That's the bottom line. Okay, now once that's done we go back into our debrief and we continue to finish it off. Now the next thing I want to talk about is some of the parts of the debrief that you can't always necessarily So... There's our debrief. So what we're going to do now is we look at certain things, with any central bank speakers today. Was there any key economic data? Yes, there was. I'm going to briefly take you to the economic data sheet that I've done already. That's the ADP from today. So again, we go and observe it. What was expected? What came out? What is that in terms of historic? Is it a high number, a low number, good, bad? What does it mean? We put things into context, we build the picture for ourselves. We then year. No real strong positive correlation with NFP but solidifies the strength. So we're going to really observe this data piece called ADP. Now why do we do that? Well it's simple. If you want to become professional at executing economic data which is a skill in its own, you've got to go through a process of learning what ADP looks like, not just on the data but also on the charts. Okay then I go and observe it in one of the German Bunds, so I look how the German Bund responded, but so important, and this is where a lot of traders leave a lot of information on the table, they look at the outcome but they don't look at the pre-context. A lot of the time markets are going to move very aggressively sometimes and sometimes they're going to move counter to what you think. It all has to do with the structure in which you find that market. Bund was trading very lethargically all morning, low volume, very, very balanced session going into this number. the market profile.

Okay and then what we do in the debrief is we then move on and we start to move to the more psychological aspects. So what were some of the emotions I thought today when I executed? Was I uncomfortable with the risk? Was I thinking about my P&L the whole time? I go and write down every single aspect that ultimately I can identify in terms of thoughts and emotions.
