What I'm going to be looking at today is kind of what we've seen recently is this sort of momentum failure pattern and both highs and lows in the bun sort of thing.

You just notice again like, so for me I'm again like you're saying, I'm noticing that's aggressive for me in terms of how we just we've taken, you know, we've absorbed 84 and clipped down 300 lots just as much. It has to be equal two-way trade, you know what I mean, it can't be sort of, you have to be clipping equal size in regards to what's being lifted. And I get caught out on this later as you'll see, but just now just notice you're seeing size trading at the lows, you're seeing someone sitting at 83 saying yeah I'll take them and then clipping down sort of thing. Notice how a little volume has started to trade, so now all of a sudden the initiative's dried out from both sides in terms of you're seeing, it looked really aggressive right through here, 85s, 84s, and now it's kind of all of a sudden slowed down and stopped. So once again, that's the kind of tell-tale sign right, I know I've got aggressive After having scaled out, I mean, I don't know this is just the nature of how I trade in terms of I Scaled out 83 is knowing that something you know that we may get this kind of bid and just just get something off the table But then now when I see the process like that what I'm gonna stay short sort of thing I'm gonna I want to add into this kind of trade and does I know my errors I want to get out 77 to 74 is I like You know, even if, you know, just the fact that we don't trade 81s and we stop like we did is potentially a sort of tell-tale sign. And, you know, just, and look how we just, similar to over here, how we slow down. You sort of, we make that initiative low or we have that kind of, it's not fast money, but in terms of there's, there's some, it looks like we're building energy. And then you're having the sideways accumulation and then it's about understanding, right, so where are the kind of pinch points in here? You've seen someone's taking 300 lots here at the low, someone's taking 800 lots here at the low. And we're back bid again, and now notice how the offer thins out, you're seeing bigger size clipping into the offer, 300 lots clipping up, just as much as you're kind of looking for this offer to stay heavy and absorb, you now need to understand we're all right. At what point are we going to see these sell clips step down? I mean, it's great to see that you're nicely on the side or whatever, 28 lots just traded 84s, no real initiative selling the sell side. You had 120 lots clip the 84s, right? Like I just said, guys, you need to have that buy size. I always talk about selling two-way trade, right? gauge price action, gauge the order flow and even in a trending market or a momentum play market you need to have two way trade to gauge where the pivots are, to understand you know understanding the sort of flow of the market and like you're just seeing here I mean it's going off it on no sides here and then you're seeing clips back straight into 83s far bigger than anything we've seen down you know I mean 123 lots at the same", "transcript": "And now we start to accumulate downloads here sort of thing. sideways accumulation in this area now.

Just notice, like you see, and this is when it starts to block out into the open, I've been talking about this with a few guys here, it just kind of, it just dies here, you know what I mean, everything thins out, there's no real size trading through, It's just stagnant.
