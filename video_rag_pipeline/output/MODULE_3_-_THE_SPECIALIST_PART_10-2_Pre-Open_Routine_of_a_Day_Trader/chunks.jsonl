But let's start off and we're going to start in part 10 with a little bit of theory. I'm going to show you firstly what a pre-open routine of a day trader would look like. Now as you can see in front of you, this is a routine that you can apply whether you're using volume profiling or not. The important thing is that Every single morning, every single day, every day you trade, you need to go through this routine and answer the questions because by answering this question you're extracting a lot of objective information from the market. it's this very objectivity that will protect you. It will help you, you know, understand when a certain strategy should be employed and when it shouldn't. It's going to help you to go with the trend or not go against the trend. And that's why we do this routine every single day, because it will help us to remain objective. So let's begin. Firstly, you need to ask yourself the question, when you look at Now, the very simple premise is that when the market is being driven fundamentally, there is a lot of flow in the market. Technicals are far less important, so volume profiling will become far less effective. However, when the markets are technical, it's going to be far better to employ technical type strategies. So that's the first question you ask yourself. Secondly, is there conviction in the move? By conviction we mean, is there confidence, is there momentum, is there high volume, is there belief in this move, does the market really believe that prices should either be higher or lower? Then, is there a flight to safety? In other words, when the market is moving risk on or risk off, we get flows that are being allocated across various asset classes. So it's important to understand, is there a genuine move in the market that is occurring because of panic, because of fear, because of maybe political risk, or is it just normal market moves that are occurring? Then are there any strong correlations? At times, if you look over the past couple of months, with all the US Federal Reserve hiking rates, there's clear correlations now between the Fed hiking rates and the stronger dollar. So whilst this strong correlation exists, we need to ensure that we're not going against these strong correlations. You know, when the correlations are in play, we don't want to be using strategies Now again, correlations become stronger and weaker over time, so it's important to understand when there are correlations across various asset classes.", "transcript": "Welcome back to part 10 guys, obviously we're going to start part 10 with some theoretical principles and then we're going to move on to some of our momentum strategies and show you a few characteristics around those, how they work, how you can execute them, make good money out of them. test you again in your playbook as you go and find those strategies.

The next thing, what is the market condition? Is it trending? Are we in an early, late or mature phase of trending? Or are we bracketing, moving sideways? What is the inventory of the market? In other words, what is the net position of the market? Are there quite a few longs in the market? What kind of longs in the market? Are they longer term, medium term, day traders, or are they short term? Then, bracketing. How's the market moving? Are we at the top of the bracket, or are we at the bottom of the bracket? How are we moving between the bracket? Where's the most volatility coming within the bracket? Now, the reason we assess the market conditions is so that we can ensure we're employing our strategies in the right context or conditions of the market. What is the volume doing at that point? Is it higher or is it lower? Is it moving higher or is it lower? Is it substantially lower? Again, remember volume is a relative term. The same thing with the range. Is the range expanding in this market or is it contracting? We then want to answer where will all various participants, longer term influential participants be getting involved? This is crucial. Remember we spoke a lot about these influential So understanding where they're likely to enter is crucial for future market movements. We then go and we determine where are our ideal trade opportunities. Those trades that you look at you say I must take this trade, this is of key importance. It's important and imperative to remind yourself of these key trades every single day. They don't come along very often, so by reminding yourself every single day, you will be ready the day that opportunity comes, and most important, you will take advantage of the opportunity the day that comes. Then, what are some of the clues from yesterday's volume profile? What are some of the easy observations that we noted from yesterday's profile? We then have a look at some of the overnight movements. Has there been movement in Asia? what are the overnight movements that we can pay attention to that can give us early clues for when our market opens. We'll then work out our opening calls and determine where the markets are going to open versus where they should open and more important determine if there is an opportunity.
