I will then briefly introduce the Footprint tool, how it works, as well as a practical example of the Footprint in action. Now let's get straight into a brief video about the Footprint course. My name is Brannigan Barrett and I'm going to be your mentor throughout this course. My background currently includes seven years of proprietary trading, six years of mentoring and this is the second course I've created, the first being the market profile course launched earlier this year. Currently I trade across multiple asset classes including bonds, equity indices, currencies and commodities and across multiple time frames including both day trading and as well as obviously swing trading. My trading philosophy is very simple. It's a gradual, consistent pursuit of high performance developed through strong habits, smart processes and simple effective trade strategies. So why has Axio Futures created a footprint course? Well very simply there's an extremely high demand for it given the fact that there's very little education out there about the footprint tool. Footprint is an extremely objective fact-based tool. Now by this very nature, if you're developing strategies based on facts, it will allow you to develop confidence in those fact-based strategies and ultimately leverage up your favorite strategies. But firstly, all of the principles we're going to teach, we are going to practically apply to live market examples. More important, some of the complex principles we're going to then explain them in layman's terms. We're then also going to include drill sessions at the end of every one of the strategy sessions to make sure that not only do you grasp the principle but you can also apply the principle to some of the drills we give you.

From unit 6 to 15, we solely focus on building strategies, executing strategies, as well as building your own templates on those strategies. Now some of the key features you can expect to see throughout all of the units begin obviously with theoretical application. We then also have the practical application of these theoretical principles. What I found in my first course was that whilst we had a great deal of practical application of the theory there was a real desire for a lot more practical application and we've taken heed of that and that's why we're going to have a number of practical examples All of them include live market strategies. Now these live market examples will not just focus on the footprint tool, but they'll include the footprint as well as the price ladder and as well as traditional candlestick charts. The reason for this is very simple, obviously a lot of you guys taking this course will be very familiar with not just the dom or the ladder, but also utilizing normal candlesticks. To ensure that it's not completely stepping out of your comfort zone, we've incorporated all three into the practical examples. Then, you can see in every Unit 6-15, we will have a template. So we've designed a very unique template that you will fill in for every single strategy so that you can form very strong habits whilst developing these strategies in Unit 6-15.

You know, things like understanding liquidity, things like understanding, you know, what habits make really effective traders.

You have to allow your mind to recover. You have to allow your mind to absorb the information it's taken in. Also, after every strategy unit, I have allocated a day of practice. Now, These days of practice can be utilized for one of two things, one you can either play catch-up on maybe a unit that you haven't completed yet, or you can even go back over the strategy unit just to make sure you understand the strategy.

Note, the trial does end after 30 days, at which point you can continue your trial Also, do note, once that charting software trial finishes, Axia Futures will then give you a one-month free subscription to our premium streaming service. The purpose of this is two-fold. Obviously, a lot of our streams do cover the footprint tool in action, where you'll hear from numerous traders referencing the footprint tool, why they utilize it, where they utilize it, what sort of trade strategies you can look out for with the footprint Secondary to that, obviously, if you join the Live Premier membership, you will also then have access to the peer-to-peer community learning section and this is a chat room where you can engage with not just a mentor but also your fellow peers who are completing or who have completed the course and who are utilizing the tool on a day-to-day basis. So guys, just make sure, you know, take this challenge, don't skip ahead. Remember, the reason I set out this challenge is so that you can avoid things like fatigue, avoid getting demotivated, avoid the stress of thinking that this is a very complex tool when in essence it's very, very simplistic. So hopefully the 30 day challenge has got you really excited about what's to come in the Footprint course.

So some of the strategies you can expect to see include both momentum as well as counter trend strategies. Not all traders are alike. Some traders don't like to necessarily go with the flow, some traders like to go against the flow. Equally, some traders like to be a little more passive in execution, whereas some traders like to be more aggressive. So we've created 10 unique strategies that will include all sorts of strategies for a whole number of different types of traders. Now note, obviously, units 5 to 11 will include footprint standalone strategies only. What this simply means is that you only require the footprint tool to not just interpret but also execute these unique strategies.", "transcript": "More importantly, though, if you do understand it, spend the entire hour or two just mulling over charts, looking for that strategy in a number of markets, utilise that trial of yours and make sure that you fully understand the strategy and can apply it to live market examples. What you will notice is that it's imperative that you only begin the trial of the footprint chart on day 2, i.e. after you've completed unit 1. Note, the trial does end after 30 days, at which point you can continue your trial Also, do note, once that charting software trial finishes, Axia Futures will then give you a one-month free subscription to our premium streaming service. The purpose of this is two-fold. Obviously, a lot of our streams do cover the footprint tool in action, where you'll hear from numerous traders referencing the footprint tool, why they utilize it, where they utilize it, what sort of trade strategies you can look out for with the footprint Secondary to that, obviously, if you join the Live Premier membership, you will also then have access to the peer-to-peer community learning section and this is a chat room where you can engage with not just a mentor but also your fellow peers who are completing or who have completed the course and who are utilizing the tool on a day-to-day basis. So guys, just make sure, you know, take this challenge, don't skip ahead. Remember, the reason I set out this challenge is so that you can avoid things like fatigue, avoid getting demotivated, avoid the stress of thinking that this is a very complex tool when in essence it's very, very simplistic. So hopefully the 30 day challenge has got you really excited about what's to come in the Footprint course.

This context we will build through utilizing candlestick charts as well as basic fundamental Let's now briefly go through the trade strategy grid. It's broken up into two basic elements. First will be momentum strategies and then counter trend strategies. Now within the momentum and counter trend strategies, you will note that some of them will require passive execution and some of them aggressive execution. This simply means passive is where you're waiting for the market to come to you and give you a certain price, whereas aggressive you have to go to the market and make the market. Now, in terms of the momentum strategies, some of the footprint standalone strategies you will see are absorption and auctioning, auction imbalances and the initiative drive.

Now in terms of the delta, what we sometimes want to look at over a series of rotations or time is the cumulative delta. To summarise, that's simply the cumulative order flow. So it's the total delta that's That can be seen in the information box below. The next element we look at is time. So again, like I mentioned, each one of these rotations can be time based. They could be 5 minutes, they could be 30 minutes, they could be daily, or they can be based on rotations. Now the next thing we look at is relative changes within a tool. And this is where the tool is highly effective because we can see two types of relative The first is with regards to the colour. Now note you'll see darker and lighter colours. The darker colours simply represent higher amounts of volume being transacted at specific prices, whereas the lighter volumes represent lower relative volume. The second type of relative change we can see is in the summary box below. We can see the relative change between volume, as well as delta, and obviously the net change in cumulative delta over a period of time or rotations. The last thing we can add to the footprint tool is other types of trading tools, such as volume weighted average price, market profiles, the 50% or the midpoint of the market, the high, the low, we can add a number of other traditional trading tools So this is an expansion now of the Footprint tool. What we're going to do next is we're going to actually look at a blackboard example and highlight all of these seven elements on a practical example utilizing the blackboard.

Now what we can see straight away obviously if we have the candlesticks there we can see the traditional open and close and obviously we can see the high and the low. However, what we cannot see is all this information in between, which is known as Delta, or volume at each price, or order flow. Okay, so by simply not having the footprint, you are discounting, or you're losing out on a whole host of information that exists to market participants. Okay, so with that in mind, let's now let's drill into the footprint chart and look at all the various elements as we discussed in the previous slide so The first things first, price. As we can see, price is being depicted on the right side of our chart. Every one of these segments is occurring at one price. So this would be price point 70, 71, 72, 73, etc, etc. So we can obviously see the footprint over a number of prices. The next thing to look at and talk about is time. Now the footprint can be depicted in two different formats of time. The first is a typical traditional time based format where we could select say a five minute footprint or a 30 minute footprint or a 60 minute footprint. Simply, each one of these rotations will be based on the selected time. Now for those of you that are more swing type or longer term traders, you can even create the footprint utilizing daily footprints. What professional traders do look at is we do have a daily footprint so that we can determine what the net Positioning is what the net Delta is at the end of each set at the end of each session Okay, the other second type of rotation type we can have which is also time-based is simply a point-and-figure Now in this example, we can see a point-and-figure because we can see that the time is varying between between each rotation So each rotation in this example is simply based on a point and figure.

So a real relative drop off, almost a massive shift in the type of volume. we nearly doubled and then we more than halved after in the next rotation okay so we can draw some really nice relative changes in terms of the volume now in terms of talking about color shading this is the real sort of crux this is the real sort of amazing incredible part about the footprint tool okay the reason being is that what the footprint tool does is it Now, colors are wonderful because we can very quickly see these colors and make very fast decisions upon them, whereas if we were just trying to calculate the net change occurring at each price, that in its own wouldn't allow us to make effective quick decisions. So let's look again at these colors and let's now take the segment that we had from earlier. So what we can see we spoke, we said there's a negative 404 delta. When we have negative deltas occurring at a price, we will always get red colors. When we have positive deltas, as we can see in this example, this will be positive 5, we get blue deltas. So when the buyers, effectively, are trading more volume at a price than sellers, we get a blue footprint segment. selling more volume than the buyers at a segment, the color will be red. Now what you can see is very quickly as you can straightaway see that the sellers were more, the sellers were more, the sellers were more, buyers more, buyers more, sellers more, sellers more, sellers more, sellers more. So we can very quickly see who's winning the net interaction over a number of prices. Now let's take it a step further and this is again also where the footprint is very very Okay, now as we'll talk a little bit about in unit two, you can obviously adjust these shades, but for reference, we're only going to utilize six shades in this example. So of those shades you get three shades of blue and three shades of red. We're going to call those light shade, medium shade, and dark shade.

Why? Because the delta is obviously more positive as there is more buying interaction taking and the darker shade of blue occurs where we have the highest positive delta at price point 80.

In other words, the information is no longer, not that it's not important, but it's no longer leading information. Now the problem with lagging information is that the market has already had time to absorb and act upon that information. So what we can see Next to that, we've got the market profile. We then have the footprint chart, the price ladder, and then obviously the book map. Now from left to right, the amount of lagging versus leading information varies, and this is what we're going to discuss in the next slide. Now before we move on and talk about some of the advantages and disadvantages of each It's not a case of simply one tool is better than the other. Like I said in the previous slides, it's about understanding how you can utilise each tool to extract meaningful information to make effective decisions. Now what I want to highlight is that sometimes lagging information is important and sometimes but that lagging information needs to correspond with the type of trade strategy we're trying to execute. Let me illustrate with a basic example. If we want to become very good breakout traders, then lagging information is of no use to us. Because lagging information, by the time we get that information, say via a close of a candle or say via a moving average or whatever it may be, by the time we get that information, the market has already utilized that information and moved accordingly. So in the example of a breakout strategy, we want to utilize leading type tools a lot more than lagging type tools. That being said, if we're looking at specific turning points in the market, or key absorption points, in those instances, we don't want to use things like level 3 data from Bookmap, or the price data, because in those instances, the information is too quick and it's too leading that it won't add value to our trade strategy. So the important thing to note is that it's about utilising a tool, whether it's lagging or leading information, and utilising it within the right trade strategy. And that's why, as we spoke about earlier in this unit, we highlighted the 10 different trade strategies and how we're going to effectively build those trade strategies", "transcript": "information.

For me as a trader, I utilize predominantly the market profile for context, the price ladder for execution and the footprint for building confidence and perfecting timing.

Now, the first tool I'm going to talk about is the most lagging, which is your traditional trading tool. So, obviously, your candlesticks with your candlestick tools, like your Bollinger Bands and your moving averages, etc., etc. Now, the weakness, the biggest weakness, is that the information is very, very stale and it's very lagging. And most importantly, these traditional tools tend to ignore actual market flows. In other words, like I was showing you earlier in the example when we drilled down the traditional candlestick, it's simply showing you the open, the close, the high and the low. It's not showing you any kind of flow or interaction going on between the buyers and sellers. Now when we move on to the next tool being the market profile, some of the weaknesses in the market profile include that it can be highly subjective. So because it's all about shape and pattern recognition, it can be quite subjective Also, it's quite a lagging informational source.

I'm going to get you to set up the footprint in a very simplistic manner. Also, as I will warn you, as we go through units two and four and five, is that don't change your settings too often. When something's not working or you're not necessarily understanding the information, don't look to change the tool just to see the information in a different manner. There's a reason we set up the tool very simply it's because it can give us Effective information that we can make strong decisions upon so the first thing is then if you don't set up the tool correctly It can be a lot of noise And then the second thing is that there are a multiple number of ways that you can set up the footprint tool. I mean, there's so much information coming in, there's so many numbers, you're seeing effectively all the information, every single contract being transacted.

Now the strengths of the footprint tool, and this is where I get very excited, and you know, I must tell you that for me, you know, the footprint tool is a real breakthrough in my career because I always felt like I was missing something that could give me the confidence, you know, to execute my strategies with a little bit more leverage and it was ultimately the footprint tool that's given me that confidence. And that confidence came because I was feeling like there were certain weaknesses I had with the tools I was utilizing. And once I found the footprint, those weaknesses have now become covered. So some of the strengths of the footprint tool, first and foremost, is that it's In other words, we're not utilising lagging information, why? Because as every contract is being bought and sold and we're seeing the physical interaction between the buyers and sellers, that is as leading information as you can get. In other words, when every buyer is buying, we can simply identify him buying, we can jump on the buying, and we can execute with the buying, rather than waiting for all that buying to be represented by, say, a candlestick, and then we've missed the buy opportunity. Then, the tool captures the most relevant information in one graphic. And that's something that's very important, is that, like I said, one of the weaknesses But if you set it up correctly, the tool can really capture all that information in one simple graphic. And that graphic is simply color-coded. So we have two colors, blue and red, and three different shades. And all that information boils down to simply two colors and three different shades. And that for me is unique. It's a lot of information that is summarized in a very simplistic manner. Delta, relative market changes. So it includes more information than any other tool that we've observed. Because of that reason, I'm very attractive to the trading tool. Note, it's a relatively simple trading tool only if set up in such a manner. Also, it's a relative indicator. This is important as well because what you'll see when we get to units 6 to 15 is we do develop trade strategies based on relative shifts. it does show us the relative changes in the volume, in the delta, in the velocity, in the volatility. Then it shows us only the actual volume trade and this is where it trumps the price ladder", "transcript": "up the footprint tool.

Note, it's an objective fact-based tool and this is particularly important, is that we're not leaving the decisions on opinions or subjective information. We can see the buying coming into the market, we can identify a strategy around this buying and we can execute on fact-based information. Then, the footprint can be utilized as a stand-alone tool but also with other tools. This is also fascinating because a lot of the time, for example, a price ladder of course it can be utilized on its own as well and with other tools, but there are certain tools that on their own are less effective than when they are combined with other tools. or in combination with other tools. It simply boils down to which trading strategy you're adopting with the tool. And lastly and the most wonderful thing is that the footprint tool ultimately allows you to perfect your timing. Why? Let's say for instance you have a trade strategy of a breakout and you're looking for a market to break above a previous important high.
