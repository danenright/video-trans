Auctions Auctions are made up of three fundamental elements, price, time and volume. Price advertises the opportunity, time regulates each opportunity and volume measures the degree of success of each auction. In order to understand any auction, it doesn't matter what the market might be, you need to understand price, time and volume. What this is telling us, in an auction, as price moves higher and lower, it's an advertisement to anyone participating within the auction. If there are high prices, various participants will participate. If there are low prices, some participants will participate. If there are fair prices, some participants will participate. At each price there's a different advertisement for different participants. In terms of the time, time measures and regulates each of these opportunities. The more time it takes, the more participants have to engage at various opportunities. Less time at a specific price represents a very advantageous opportunity, whereas a longer time at a various price represents not as advantageous. In terms of the volume, higher volume tends to tell us there's a lot of success of the auction, whereas low volume tends to tell us there's less participation or less involvement at those prices. In terms of fair value, fair value is the price level that's attracting the greatest volume of trades. So fair value is where we spend most of our time trading. Why? Because fair value depicts or tells us the point in the market where buyers and sellers If they are therefore in agreement, it's very very difficult to expect buyers to buy up higher prices and sellers to sell lower prices and that is why we tend to spend a lot of time around fair value. Identifying fair value is pivotal in understanding forces within the market. The reason being is once we've identified fair value, we then need to be cautious expecting a resumption of the trend. Markets can spend a long, long time trading around fair value before continuing in one direction or another, and that is why it's pivot to understand when a market has found fair value. In terms of volume, volume determines whether or not divergences from value can be sustained. Some days, buyers and sellers can be discouraged from moving away from fair value, and this On other days, however, we can see price move very quickly away from value as it attracts", "transcript": "Let's now discuss the basic elements of the auction process.
