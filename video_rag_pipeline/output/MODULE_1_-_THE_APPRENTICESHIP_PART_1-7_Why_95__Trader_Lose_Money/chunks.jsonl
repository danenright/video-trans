Now, this is one of the first discussions I would have with any young trader or any of the guys I would mentor and the reason I go over this first is I almost want to get rid of a lot of these hidden fallacies within the trading environment. I think a lot of people seem to think or there's this illusion that trading is easy and you can make a lot of money quick and that it's an amazingly fun job. to discuss early on so that I can kind of just bring you back to reality. Now there's a couple of key characteristics that define the 95% of people that fail so in essence if we knew why 95% of people fail so long as we don't do that so long as we avoid those pitfalls surely by that definition we should then be part of the 5% that succeed. So what are these what I'm going to say is going to sound a little bit counter-intuitive. However, in the beginning of your career when you start trading, when you're learning about the markets, trying to understand the markets, in essence you need to over trade a little bit. Why? Because the quicker you make mistakes, the more often you make mistakes, the quicker you're going to be able to learn from those mistakes. So as a trader in the beginning, be aggressive, be assertive, But do this on a demo account, do this on an account that is not real money. Once you've made those mistakes, once you enter the live market with real money, we no longer overtrade. What we do is we take our edge, we take our strategy and implement it. We don't force new strategies in the market, we don't force ourselves in the market. So the first characteristic is overtrading. The second characteristic is trading without a defined edge. A lot of traders out there think they have an edge, they think that they bought because they read it on Twitter or they heard that there's this new tool out there. However, that's not a defined edge. A defined edge is where you look at a market, you have a logical process and you execute based on that process. That is an edge and that is what you're required to succeed. Now a lot of traders they they have a no defined edge because they tend to try a little bit more Subjectively versus objectively and we're going to talk about this a little later on Emotional decision-making now. I know a lot of you would have experienced this before This is one of the key pitfalls for most new traders. They get into a bad trade. They get into a sticky position They're unsure what to do. They don't cut the position They hold the position and the next thing I do a lot more damage now It's not the financial damage that does the most damage, it's the psychological damage.", "transcript": "Hi guys, part one, why 95% of traders lose money?

In other words, the scar that is developed as a result of a bad decision. So emotional decision making is one of the reasons why traders never fully recover and eventually fail. Ego. We need not speak about this. If you're a trader, to an extent, you probably need to have a little bit of an ego. You need to have a little bit of surety and confidence in your ability. It's okay to be confident, but not be overconfident. The minute you step out of the realm of what you're used to doing, the minute you start trading more size than you used to, or you start slacking and thinking you know it all and stop learning, that is when the market catches up with you, and that is when the market takes money away from you. Then, not enough time spent on interpretation. I see this all the time, guys. So many traders out there, they tend to look at the markets and just trade the but they never actually go back and look at the trades they did, look at the execution, look at how they did things, how they managed certain trades. It's only through managing or at least spending time on your interpretation and understanding of the markets are you going to fully develop yourself and more importantly become successful. They fight trends. 95% of people end up fighting trends. Now it's okay to be a counter trend, it's okay to fade a trend. But what it's not okay to do is when you've identified strength in a market or momentum in a market, it's not okay to fade. So remember, it's fine to go against the trend, but do it when you understand that you are against the trend so that you can manage yourself accordingly. Take big losses. Again, as day traders, as professional traders, our number one job is money management. So, if we're not managing our money correctly, if we're losing 10-20% of our portfolio in any single day, we are never going to succeed in the long term because it's very unlikely or very unusual for a trader to make 20% return on his portfolio in one day. So remember, if you're not going to make 20% in one day, you shouldn't be losing 20% in one day.
