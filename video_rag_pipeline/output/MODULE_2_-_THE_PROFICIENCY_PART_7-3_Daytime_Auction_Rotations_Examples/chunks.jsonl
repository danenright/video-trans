In the first chart you will see an example of two time framing. What it looks like, and I think the best way to illustrate this is to compare it In the example you can see in both instances the market sells off, but the manner in which it sells off is showing the control that the seller exhibits. Now in the first example you can see whilst the seller is selling the market, it is running into responsive type buying and that's why we kind of get the nice aggressive down move and then we get quite a bit of two-way trade before we then get a little grind lower and a little bit of two-way trade and a grind lower. prices do shift lower, the manner in which they shift is important to interpret and understand. Whereas the second example you can see, the seller takes far more aggressive control of of candles, but more important, one of the most important identifiers of one-time framing is that we do not take out the previous candle's high, or the previous TPO of the previous high of the candle. Now, What you can see in that second example is we're continuously grinding lower and lower, forming lower lows and lower highs. When we see this sort of one time framing, we can afford to be a little more aggressive on entry. However, when we see the two time framing, we then need to be a bit more passive on entry as the market will give us more favorable prices if we're patient. So that's why we want to identify and differentiate between the auction rotations. If it's two time framing, more passive and wait for the advantageous entry. If it's one time framing, be more aggressive because the market's not going to give you the desired prices if you wait for it. And then in terms of auction volatility expansion and contraction, it's just how the size of the number of TPO's or the number of prices that we trade over at any given point. So again what you can see early on in the third example, the market has very small ranges, and then all of a sudden towards the back end of the day we get a very very large candle or a very large range and the volatility just picks up marginally towards the session. So again, important to understand when the price response or the volatility is contracting as well as when it's expanding.
