So as you can see, a trending market occurs 20-30% of the time. Now again, this is not a hard fast percentage. majority of the time the markets are bracketing and ranging, whereas very very seldom or far less likely are markets trending. Now again, this varies guys, when there's a lot of fundamentals in the market, when there's a lot of central bank action, then it's likely we see trends occurring more often, but central banks and fundamentals can go quiet for quite Take for example 2014, we saw a lot of bracketing markets because there was very little going on as all the central banks had kind of almost reached rock bottom and were already sort of into their QE program. So crucially you understand that these bracketing and trending markets do change and they do shift and the important thing for you to understand is not necessarily what the percentages are but what are the identifiers of when we move between bracketing and trending So let's look at trending markets and some of the characteristics firstly markets are said to be trending when there is very little Responsive other time frame participants. So remember bracketing we said buyers initiate at lower prices They continue to initiate until they run into responsive sellers when they run into responsive sellers Those sellers as prices move higher will eventually turn into initiative sellers That initiative then forces prices lower and eventually buyers stop initiating and they then turn to responsive buyers at lower prices again and this continues over a period of time. The reverse is the trending market. There is very little responsive. Now just give you a basic example just to illustrate this. If you were to look at for instance this volume profile we have as an example let's say for instance that a new piece of news came out and that OPEC delegates had decided that they were going to pump to record oil inventories and what occurred over the period of the day was prices continue to sell off all day. Now straight away you've got to say to yourself Who in their right mind, as a longer-term institution, you know it's influential, who would look to want to stand against something very, you know, fundamentals that are very new to the market. And if you think of it that way, you'll quickly realize why no one would want to be a responsive buyer. Now, it's not to say that you won't get any kind of buying. Of course you will. This would be much shorter timeframe buying, you know, liquidity providers, you know, liquidity but again relatively speaking there will be very little muted response of buying and that's the key to identifying whether a market is trending or bracketing.", "transcript": "Now let's look at the other type, the trending type of market.

This would be much shorter timeframe buying, you know, liquidity providers, you know, liquidity but again relatively speaking there will be very little muted response of buying and that's the key to identifying whether a market is trending or bracketing. We said to be trending when there's a strong divergence of price away from fair value. So again, it's crucial to always interpret and look, where was maybe the previous day's fair value? Where did the market accept price the previous day? As well as however we've been accepting price over the last couple of sessions. If you find all of a sudden that we've been accepting value relatively well and all of a sudden on one day the market very quickly begins to move away from fair identifier of potential trend that could be developing. Then trending when a series of day auctions moving in a clear direction, so one-time framing. Again, I will illustrate one-time framing for you at some point, but again, just important, one-time framing is a control factor where we see the auctions moving in one direction. And then we have very minimal overlap of value areas. We will talk about overlap of value areas again at a later point, but by overlap we merely mean if the value area today was say between the price of $30 and $40, minimal overlap would mean if tomorrow we suddenly trade between $20 and $30. So very little overlap between today's value area and the previous value area. initiative or responsive. And we're going to talk about this as we go a little further along. I'm going to show you some interesting examples and we're going to develop some strategies based on finding those, not necessarily guessing where those tops are, but I'm going to show you a couple of key clues that the market gives you when it is trying to actually turn around and we run into some form of responsive So we get three parts to a trend phase and this is crucial to understand because again you need to be thinking about these factors when developing your strategies. So you get the early part of a trend which is the trendsetters and this is the phase where effectively a new piece of information is in the market, participants want to aggressively initiate because prices are trading at an extreme discount or an extreme premium based on the new information so that's the early part of the trend. part of the trend or the maturing phase of the trend.
