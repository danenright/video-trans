So on the left hand side or the blue column are all the bids The bids as you can see on the prices on the left that represents all the buy orders Then next you have your price column and that's the gray area It's the price of Pacific market that you'll be any Pacific market that you're looking at Then next we have the offers or the asks and that is the red column and where the bids and the office meet is the currently traded price. Next we have the high of the high of day and the current high of day is 3095 as per the slide and that's a high of day is indicated by the Yellow line at the top where it goes from dark gray to a light gray So it's the higher the day of the market next. We have the low of day, which is at 3066 and that's indicated by the red line which separates the gray Pricing box area to the light gray price boxing area. Then next we have the volume profile as indicated by the blue histograms that are lying on their side so it just shows you how much volume has been traded relative to the entire day. You have not only the blue histogram but you actually also have the number that's being traded at that price. Next you have so if you were to see the actual size so for example the price of 3079 we have 1607 lots so that 1607 lots could be could represent one person with all that size or a whole host of different people unless you have level 3 data this is two levels of data. Unless you have level three data, you don't quite know what that one thousand six hundred and seven knots is comprised of. But at that price, at three oh seven nine, we have one thousand six hundred and seven knots. And that dynamically changes every split second, every second and so forth. So that is how you, and that's on the offer. So that because this is the red side, this is on the offer side. Next, we have at the 3069, we have 3003 lots on the bid at 3069 and that's the current bid that if you wanted to sell the market, if you wanted to offer the market, you could", "transcript": "So now we're ready to go looking at specific components that make up a price ladder So please ensure that you do have your price ladder up because as I go through each of these elements You're able to look at at it on your live ladder in real time on your TT ladder environment, so firstly Let's have a look at where the bids are.
