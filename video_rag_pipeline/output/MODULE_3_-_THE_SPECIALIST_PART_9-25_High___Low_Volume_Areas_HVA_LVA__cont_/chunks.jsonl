Firstly, keep accurate notes of low volume areas. Why? Because they are key reference points. Now again, remember a low volume area is not just on a day to day profile. We spoke a lot about composite profiles, so you can apply any of these principles both low and high volume areas onto any kind of profiles from daily to weekly to monthly. Now note, you want to be trading with the predominant prevailing short term trend. So in the example that you can see here, we have almost a double distribution formed at But what you can clearly see is that the morning period spent at the higher end of prices we then had an initiative move from sellers and the market then began to facilitate trade in the lower bound of the day's range. Now note the low volume area or the single TPOs that are untraded both in terms of And the important thing to understand with regards to this is that we want to be maintaining short side trades only so long as the low volume area or single prints remain. Note, once the low volume area begins to fill, you want to look for two-way trade. In other words, once we start to get above and fill in those single prints, not only short side trades, but we then want to potentially look for long trades to fill in the low volume area and turn it into the potential high volume area. Now note, the question you need to ask yourself is in which direction do you wish to see rejection? So again, And this brings into mind the idea of trade location. So again, you've got to ask yourself, would it be easier in this example where there's a little bit of conviction in the trend, would you want to be buying this market or would you prefer to be selling it? And the simple answer is that whilst buy-side opportunities, as you can see, were effective and the market didn't continue lower, that is a much higher probability trade than to short where a sponsor-seller re-enters the market ahead of the single print and the low volume area. Now note, you want to place orders in the market to be looking for short-side trades in and around the low volume area. Once the market no longer continues to hold the area where responses sellers are entering ahead of those single prints, abandon the trade first. Do not be last, otherwise you're going to give back unnecessary profits.
