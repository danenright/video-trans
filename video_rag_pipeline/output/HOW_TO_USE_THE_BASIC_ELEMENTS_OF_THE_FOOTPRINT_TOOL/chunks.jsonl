Now, what CQG is brilliant for, and I'll tell you 100%, they're fantastic, is when it comes to both their contact customer support feature as well as their live chat. do ask them in the live chat. They're incredibly quick to respond. Remember obviously CQG is based in Europe so they will respond in both European time as well as obviously the US session.

Now, obviously just scrolling a little bit further down, some of the other things you want to pay attention to is obviously your system preferences.

So this is kind of like the overall view of the product. As you can see, the background we've got right now is grey, so there's not a great deal you would need to do under the Preferences tab. Then what is quite important is this little feature here called the import export pages and components.

It's very simply, it's a drag and drop type feature where you can very quickly snap pictures, snap charts, snap all sorts of strategies and post them into your debrief.

We simply click on it. Once we've got that we can obviously scroll down and we can see the gold here and the code is GCE. Okay, now again obviously you'll find all the different codes for the products you're going to utilize but for you guys I've got the codes we're going to utilize throughout this course. So take a picture of this now for the For the GBPUSD or sterling it's BP6, for gold it's GCE, for the E-Mani S&P 500 it's EP, and for the WTI oil it's CLE. Now remember, all of the examples I use, all the drills I show you guys, will be based on these five products only. The reason we've used these five products, obviously, is they're very liquid. Obviously most futures traders will trade one of these five products, so it's a good way for us to show you the tool, show you how the tool is quite effective, and obviously show you the strategies that can be utilized within these five markets.

Now I would suggest to not play with this too much. Again, you're entitled to, if you really want to make your background black and you know, play around with the colors, that's great, but just keep in mind time is precious. You know, utilize your time to understanding the tool and developing the strategies rather than getting a cool funky background. Keep it simple. The important thing to understand is that to bottom and left to right. And the first thing to point at is this little green logo in the background. Now if you left click on that you will see that you can ultimately replicate charts. You can also take the chart that you're currently seeing take it out of the current page and put it into one of the other three pages that you have. Okay, now where this is useful is, and this is a major suggestion or a tip I'm going to give you. In the beginning, before you create four different pages, make sure you're happy with one separate page. So make all the adjustments, all the preference choices, all the different things on one chart and then go and replicate that chart and put it in your other pages. Okay, and you would simply do this by replicating. You see a second chart comes up. You then go and click on window out of the page. You can see it suddenly goes red and you're then able to drag it and drop it into one of the other three pages.

You can create an image of this Alright, once we've done that, this toolbar here at the top, that is where we're going to click next. Now in this instance we're going to right click. Now by right clicking we can take this chart and we can very quickly turn it into any one of the other types of charts. So we can turn it into a line chart, we can turn it into a tick chart, we can do any number of things with this chart simply by right clicking on the bar above. Okay, in terms of what else we can do obviously we definitely want to be able to change chart interval So this is where you do it Right click on the top bar come down to the chart interval and you can select any type of chart interval All right in terms of then further on this in terms of continuation settings obviously futures markets do roll So I would highly recommend that you always have it on continuation settings and as you'll see now if I go right click on it the", "transcript": "you can click on it there. If you want to set up any kind of formula, you can click on it there, as well as obviously save and navigate between your four pages. Alright, now let's go back to this window and let's move on and create ourselves a chart. So we're going to come onto the new window and we're going to click on the chart and we're going to get ourselves Now note, obviously, the marker defaults to a white background. Now I would suggest to not play with this too much. Again, you're entitled to, if you really want to make your background black and you know, play around with the colors, that's great, but just keep in mind time is precious. You know, utilize your time to understanding the tool and developing the strategies rather than getting a cool funky background. Keep it simple. The important thing to understand is that to bottom and left to right. And the first thing to point at is this little green logo in the background. Now if you left click on that you will see that you can ultimately replicate charts. You can also take the chart that you're currently seeing take it out of the current page and put it into one of the other three pages that you have. Okay, now where this is useful is, and this is a major suggestion or a tip I'm going to give you. In the beginning, before you create four different pages, make sure you're happy with one separate page. So make all the adjustments, all the preference choices, all the different things on one chart and then go and replicate that chart and put it in your other pages. Okay, and you would simply do this by replicating. You see a second chart comes up. You then go and click on window out of the page.

So for me, volume is particularly important, so I'm going to add that on. I'm then going to go add another study and I'm going to call it the moving average. and we've now got two studies, and last but not least let's add one more study called the average true range. Okay, so now you can see very quickly we've got three studies, the candlesticks and the 60-minute chart now. So important is to be able to modify these studies. To do that, simply click or right-click on the study you want to modify. So if it's the moving average, we simply right-click on it, we modify the moving average, and when the screen pops up, we can do all sorts of wonderful things. For one, we can change the period. It's currently 21 days, let's change it to 20. The type of moving average we can change from simple, smooth, exponential, weighted, whatever we like. In terms of the color, we can simply change it here and maybe make it not green, maybe make it pink. Okay, so that's how you would modify your tool. Again, you can do the same thing obviously for the volume, you can modify it or you can modify the average true range. So that's how you would set up your basic candlestick chart. Now I'm going to just scroll it, obviously notice what I just did there, I can make this as small as I like, I can make it as large as I like, ultimately for this course I'm just simply going to have two charts, one will be a candlestick and one will be a footprint chart.

I'm going to go through each one of these in very specific detail and the reason The choices you have will ultimately represent the information in a different way. Now, be warned, and this is a very, very important lesson to learn. You don't want to play or constantly be playing with your charts. The whole purpose of a chart is to be able to represent data in a very meaningful way. Now, one of the mistakes a lot of young traders make is they constantly either adding tools, so maybe one strategy is not working, so they suddenly add Bollinger Bands and you cannot begin to develop consistency and pattern recognition if you're constantly adjusting the tool, because you're not measuring every day, you're not measuring apples with apples.

Now all the source type is, is it's saying what sort of a footprint do you want?

Now I'm going to show you the difference so you can see what they look like. I'm just going to apply this and move out of the way.

Now if we say OK to that, we can see currently in the top here, we can see that it's set to 60 minute bars. So right now the footprint has a setting of 60 minute bars. So every 60 minutes we will get a new footprint line. Obviously, because it's set to that, I have got a chart time frame that I can set this with. Now, again, you can go set up a one minute footprint, or you can set up a daily footprint. Now, this is very, very handy, particularly when you want to see, for instance, what the positioning is day to day. So if you want to quickly see what the delta is from day to day, you can simply use a day to day market profile delta. the source, and that will be the point and figure. Now the point and figure simply works on rotations. Now what that means is that whenever the market rotates a certain number of ticks in one direction, and then reverses a certain number of ticks, it will only then show you the new line or the new footprint. So let's take a basic example. The point and figure, the reversal set to 3, I'm going to make this 10, and what you'll see is that ultimately, every time the market moves 10 ticks up, you'll get a rotation. So you can see we have a very large rotation. The first 10 tick pullback gives us a new rotation. And that's all a point and figure is. For a large part of this course, we are going to use rotations, reason being is that they show auctioning very, very well. Equally we are going to use the bar charts. We're going to show time-based auctions because they're a lot better for relative shifts and relative changes. We will use them both. You will get a lot of practice at this. For now what I suggest is let's go and create two of them so you're ready for the footprint course. So as you can see right now we've got it on rotation, we've got it on oil. Let's go and rename this. We then want to create a second footprint, but this time we're going to create a 5 minute bar chart. So like with the candlestick, we simply left click on the plus, we then go and right click on the footprint, we modify the footprint, and we go to the source, where we change it from point and figure to the bar. Okay, we simply select that, we right click on the top bar, go to the chart interval So now you can see if we go and rename this as well, let's just call this oil, and we call it 5 min. So straight away now we can very quickly flick between an oil rotation as well as an", "transcript": "a candlestick. And with the bar I can set various time frames. So let's right click on it again, we go Modify and we choose the source and we say Bar. Now if we say OK to that, we can see currently in the top here, we can see that it's set to 60 minute bars. So right now the footprint has a setting of 60 minute bars. So every 60 minutes we will get a new footprint line. Obviously, because it's set to that, I have got a chart time frame that I can set this with. Now, again, you can go set up a one minute footprint, or you can set up a daily footprint. Now, this is very, very handy, particularly when you want to see, for instance, what the positioning is day to day. So if you want to quickly see what the delta is from day to day, you can simply use a day to day market profile delta. the source, and that will be the point and figure. Now the point and figure simply works on rotations. Now what that means is that whenever the market rotates a certain number of ticks in one direction, and then reverses a certain number of ticks, it will only then show you the new line or the new footprint. So let's take a basic example. The point and figure, the reversal set to 3, I'm going to make this 10, and what you'll see is that ultimately, every time the market moves 10 ticks up, you'll get a rotation. So you can see we have a very large rotation. The first 10 tick pullback gives us a new rotation. And that's all a point and figure is. For a large part of this course, we are going to use rotations, reason being is that they show auctioning very, very well. Equally we are going to use the bar charts. We're going to show time-based auctions because they're a lot better for relative shifts and relative changes. We will use them both. You will get a lot of practice at this. For now what I suggest is let's go and create two of them so you're ready for the footprint course. So as you can see right now we've got it on rotation, we've got it on oil. Let's go and rename this. We then want to create a second footprint, but this time we're going to create a 5 minute bar chart.

Now let's go and have a look at the different types of footprint styles you can get. And this is quite crucial because we will be utilizing quite a few of these throughout Unit 4. So again we right click on the footprint, we come to the study parameters, we then go and drop down on this style. And you can see there's five different styles of footprint you can select. Now the first Now, the delta is just very simply the net interaction between buyers and sellers at a price. So what do we mean by that? Again, don't get too concerned about this. You're going to hear me talk a lot about this later on in the course. But very simply, if we look at the current charger, we can see that the price is currently trading $57.46. at that price of 46 have lifted 41 more contracts than the sellers have sold at that price 46 and that's why it's represented as green. So in other words the net interaction is that there's more buying by 58 contracts than there is selling at price point 46. Okay and obviously that's constantly updating as the market's moving, it's constantly summarizing the picture occurring at that price point So that's just the delta guys, that's just the net interaction between the buyer and seller at each price. So if we were to select a different style we could select for instance the bid and ask. Now in this instance we're not getting the net interaction between buyers and sellers, we are actually getting the exact interaction, so we're getting the total interaction that's occurring. Now I want to go through this quickly and make We can see again the markets obviously now got two numbers here with an X in between All this simply means is that again if we look at price point 46 on this price point The buyers have lifted the offer for 81 contracts, but there's been no selling at price point 46 Okay, so if we go one low we can see at price point 45 we can see the buyers have bought 313 contracts and the sellers have sold 331 contracts. All right, so all we're seeing in this instance now is we're not seeing the net you know interaction between buyers and sellers. We're seeing the individual interaction between buyers and sellers.

Okay, let's right click on it again, let's go and modify the footprint, and this time let's go and select the volume as our source. Now very simply, this is a straightforward one, it just accumulates the total volume at each price and represents it on a chart. We will not use this style throughout the course, not because it doesn't necessarily but you can definitely develop strategies. But just remember what I said, whatever tool you choose or whatever format you choose, just make sure you're consistent in that approach, stick by it. Alright, another style we can use obviously is if we go to profile, and if we apply that, this now we can simply see that the market just gives us a profile in terms of volume. So we've got a volume profile now instead of just the volume in Again, some traders do utilize this, it's very good for seeing shape, but again we do have the profiles for that as a separate tool, so we don't actually use this and we will not use this in the course. But it is again a style that you could potentially look at to develop strategy. And then lastly the imbalance, this is something we will again look at and all the imbalance does now is it's exactly the same as the bid and ask, as you can see it looks exactly the same, except in this instance you can set the market to show you where imbalances occur. Now I'm going to keep it very simple explaining this, we will utilize this a little bit Versus selling at a certain price. Okay, so it's a relative shift. So for example if we go up and we have a look at this little rotation we can see that as the market is selling off we can see that at this price point between 50 and 49 sellers sold 139 versus buying 53 at the price above. So this is showing you where there's an imbalance between the best bid and the best offer and it's showing you effectively the intentional aggression from either buyers or sellers. Now An imbalance is created when it crosses a certain threshold, and we will talk a lot more about this later on. For now, just understand that when there's a big variance between the interaction between sellers and buyers, between two prices, it creates various imbalances.

Okay so we will talk about that a little bit later on. It is a strategy we're going to develop ultimately, and I'm not going to give too much away, but when you do get these imbalances, we do tend to see that initiative or that imbalance continue in that direction. That's what you can see in this example. and ultimately prices continued lower, all the way down to 40 ones. Okay, so those are the five different sources you can use. We are only going to utilize three of them throughout this course and they are the Delta, the bid ask and the imbalance. Okay, obviously the rest of this I will go through in unit 4, so don't panic too much. I'll show you where the threshold and imbalance come in, I'll show you the different elements of the min difference, etc. etc. But for now let's keep it simple, let's get used to utilizing the basic elements The last thing you can do obviously is the display. So this is where you'll select how strong or weak you want your colors. I do like bright colors so this is where I would select it. You can also select the size and the width of the certain things you would like and again that's for you to play with. One of the things I do really really like is I like to have a candlestick alongside click on the Nunya, go click the size you want it to be and select the colors you would like and you will see that all of a sudden when I push OK I can see the candlestick trading alongside the footprint okay that candlestick works like a normal candlestick we opened here we closed here, the next candle opened on the low and closed here okay so that's the basic elements of setting up your footprint chart now modify your footprint, keep it on a basic bid and ask. Most of the examples I show you and most of the strategy sessions we are going to utilize the bid and ask. Why? Well it's very simple. The bid and ask incorporates most of the kind of information you need to see on the footprint. Okay so we're going to click apply and we're going to push OK. Now again, just like the candlesticks, you can add various features and tools and studies and I'm going to show you the two most important studies or three most important studies you want to add to your footprint and to do that again we're going to right click and we're going to go and add a study and once we've done that we're simply going to type firstly", "transcript": "about this later on.

We're also going to go right click, add another study. This time we're going to type in market profile. Again quite a nice study to have. Let's type in Okay, we'll find this in a minute. Let's also get up a, and this is probably the most crucial one, let's get up a FPBS, and this is simply a footprint bar statistic. So this is a summary, and it's probably the most important, you know, statistics you can get with the footprint tool. Okay, so I'm going to go through these individually. Obviously at the top we've got the volume. That's simply the total volume within this bar. We then have the delta, that's the net interaction that's occurring in this bar. We then have the delta on the day, so that's the cumulative delta, the cumulative interaction of the entire course of the session that is occurring. We then have bi-volume and cell volume, that's simply the total bi-volume in this bar versus the total cell volume in this bar. You will note straight away that the difference between the bi-volume and the cell volume You can also then see the maximum the delta was in this bar as well as the minimum the delta was in this bar as well as obviously the delta change which is simply just the delta from this previous bar to the current bar.

For me the only ones you really want are the top three, so simply unclick and apply. So again the reason we remove all of that is because within these three statistics Alright, now before we then move on, I just want to show you how to obviously utilize the basic clicks as well as color lines and the importance of color lines. So it's quite simple to get a line, just a basic horizontal line. We simply left click on the price and we can move up and down. When you read to place it, we left click again.

So don't be alarmed, you don't have to remember this too much, I will tell you what certain colors mean. for instance dark blue to show where there's a potential for an unwind of the delta. So take for example, yeah we can see obviously the delta is quite negative in this oil market, negative 8,000. Let's say for intents and purposes I thought that once we get below this uh... sorry Once we get above this 50-60 to the upside, the shorts will get out, that delta will begin to unwind, and the aggressive nature of the sellers, they'll start to take profits.

Now, the reason I do this is because, let's say for, you know, I'm focusing on a number of markets and I've been waiting for this key level in oil, you know, in my preparation I can put all sorts of colorful lines in the market so that when the market gets there, I don't have to think, oh okay, what was these 56s? Okay, I know it's obviously an area I was focusing on, an area of potential stops And that's the purpose for color lines, but again, don't worry too much. I will show you all the color lines I use, why I use them, and ultimately hopefully you can adopt this habit into your trading. Okay, obviously with regards to just basic trend lines and all that for the candlestick chart like I said, again you can just right click and you can go and add a pointer tool. There's the trend line, and you can simply just draw any kind of trend lines you want. And remember guys, it's a very functional tool, so you can simply right click, you can remove the trend, you can set the trend color, you can do any kind of thing you want. You can add the price alert so that when it gets below a certain price or a certain point you can tell the software to give you various alerts.
