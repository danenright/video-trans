In part four we're going to discuss four important elements. First we're going to discuss volume profiling anomalies. We're then going to move on to the basic process of trading using volume profiles. I'm then going to show you a very basic trade strategy using volume profiles. We will then finish off by me giving you a nice tutorial on how to set up your volume profiles using your free demo with trading technologies. Let's now get into part four, trading anomalies. So what is a volume profile anomaly? Well, very simply, an anomaly is anything that shouldn't be there. It's anything that looks different to what is normally there. Now the wonderful thing with using volume profiles is because we're used to seeing the same pattern or very similar patterns all the time, when we do get one of these anomalies it does stick out like a golden fish. The more important thing to understand is when you see these anomalies, whilst they are rare, they do present unique trading strategies. I will show you some key strategies using these anomalies as we progress into Module 2 and 3. So the basic type of anomaly, one, a non-symmetrical profile. Non-symmetrical means non-normal distribution. Now this just means something that's not normally distributed or not the normal shape that we're used to seeing. things like gaps and things like volume skew. These anomalies give us very important information about what and how buyers and sellers are interacting with one another and they do present unique trading strategies. Another type of anomaly is a poor auction extreme. What do we mean by that? Well, we expect when a market makes a high or a low, we expect that it makes a high based on very little buy-side action and quite a lot of sell-side action. So when a market makes a bad high, or we see quite a lot of buy-side action at a high or a lot of sell-side action at a low, we tend to call that a poorly auctioned high or low. This anomaly presents an opportunity, either on the same day or on the following days. So why do we identify these anomalies? Well, as we said before, these anomalies will present unique trading strategies. We will discuss these strategies in depth as we move into Module 2 and 3.", "transcript": "Welcome to part four.
