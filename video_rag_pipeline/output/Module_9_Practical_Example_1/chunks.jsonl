So now let's now traded towards the 14s which is at the high. Now as you can see if you look and this is the current range of the market and this is on a pre-cash session so before 8 a.m. UK time and once you start getting to know your market intimately you start understanding what is high volume and what is low volume for your market and what is high velocity exchange and what is low velocity exchange for a particular session and because when you start understanding the personality and the nature of your market and how much it trades at certain periods you're absolutely able to understand when there's a potential reloader, when you see an anomaly amount of volume going through on a price. So what's actually happened over here is that the market had a VPOC OBS, so you had about 2,600 lots at 167.02, you had over here, sorry wait, over here 1,800 lots and 1,003 and then what happened the market traded up and then it shifted the most amount of volume up towards the 11s so as you can see over here we've got a volume point of control shift this is the most volume traded at a price of 3,200 now what's happened is that As we increased the volume activity towards the high, the market flipped above the VPOC area. Now what's really important is this is going to continue. And this is what we're going to watch at the moment. So let's have a look. how this trades out.

So at the moment, there's actually a little order, the trader's putting a little order here, 6709, a slow volume node, but what we've noticed is that after it flipped towards the 15s, it's starting to shift back towards the 12s and 11s. So there hasn't really been a momentum shift towards the upside. So the market is just... flipped up a few ticks, didn't trade much and what you start happening over here there's a seller reloading of the 13s so if you look at this video again and you replay just before you see this little bubble pop up you see that someone is reloading not with much size yet but with about you know a couple of 50 lots and as the offer disappears it gets this pattern at the moment. So let's see how this plays out So we can see now it's come back to the volume point of control at the at the 11th And we're really watching this rather closely now. So as this market really starts Starts trading we we want to start looking at a particular type of pattern and the execution order flow type is Absorption reloader and this is how we create our methodology to analyzing all of our parts price at a place So you have this matrix in your head on how to really develop your ability to read the price ladder so then the pattern type is iceberg and volume slice zone so what we're trying to see is in this area is there a seller a seller that keeps on reloading the offer and when we observe that potential seller that's reloading the offer what type of trading strategy do we want to deploy? And the training strategy that we want to deploy is we want to distribute amongst the iceberg and wrap it and wrap it sculpt. So essentially what I'm what I'm talking about over here is that as you notice the iceberg, you want to maybe distribute some clips. you know in this area as you look towards maybe potentially back towards the low volume node and you're scalping you so you get filled for one tick you get out for one tick you get filled you know near the highs you maybe take it for two ticks and you keep on it so long as the iceberg is in so long as the iceberg is absorbing any bi-type orders you want to be working yourself and partnering yourself with the iceberg so you're going to be training on the ladder and this is where we're observing it you know at the moment and you're distributing your clips so that's the training strategy and then the ladder market environment preferably high volatility and volume exchange the higher the volatility and the higher the volume exchange the easier it is to see a seller when the volatility environment is low and the liquidity is low and the volume is low it's very hard to see an orthotic market it is a a strong iceberg strong volume slice order because there's not much flow going through you can't see what's", "transcript": "Now what's really important is this is going to continue.

We've come back to 13s, the market has really taken out all those bids again and the seller at $13,000 has come straight back in again.
