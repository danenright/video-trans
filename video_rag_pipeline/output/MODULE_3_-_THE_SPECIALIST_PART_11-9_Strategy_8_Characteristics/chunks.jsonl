We're going to be talking about day 2 trend. Now this is a fantastic day type, a fantastic strategy and the simple reason why is because It's the day after a trend day. In other words, you can identify a day to trend strategy and have a lot of time to think about how you're going to execute, what your rules are going to be as to how you're going to execute, how you're going to manage the trade, and so forth and so forth. It's a wonderful opportunity to really make some really good, easy money by identifying just some really good, smart execution. as to how we're going to one, identify the strategy and execute and manage the strategy. Now the first thing to understand about day two after a trend is that Now, when there is a trend day in the market, by definition, we know that there's very strong initiative that has taken place the day before. So we've seen all time frame participants getting into the market, getting into the same direction of the market, and we've seen the market move aggressively either to the upside or to the downside. Now the important thing to understand is that the psychology of traders after a trend compared to normal situations. Now, the reason is very simple. Firstly, let's say a market has very aggressively trended to the upside. Now, what you've got to bear in mind is that one, as this market has moved higher and higher and higher and higher, anyone that's short has had to stop out and stop out and stop out and stop out. Equally, as this market has moved up aggressively, a lot of longs have failed to get onto the trend. So not only have we seen some shorts being stopped out of their positions, but we've also seen longs unable to get onto the trend. and nervousness surrounding day two. And what I mean by that, in other words, anyone that failed to get on the trend the day before now feels that maybe they don't want to be too aggressive, they'd rather wait for a pullback, and equally, anyone that was trying to short the trend and not quite seeing what was occurring, they've taken a lot of substantial losses on the short side, and so they're also a little bit tentative to short it or get onto the long side. So there's almost a complete. disbelief in the trend and it's that disbelief that gives us the opportunity and the characteristics I'm going to show you in a minute now.

Some of the key things to understand before we go into the actual characteristics is the potential day types you could see. So there's three very specific day types you're going to see and they are as follows. So first and foremost is where we have the traditional hangover day. So let's say this was our previous day's trend day. A hangover day would typically be where the market stays well inside the previous top quartile or in a downtrend within the bottom quartile. So that would be our first example. Our second example would again be a form of a hangover day, but we would at least extend upon the previous day's extreme. So a little bit something like that, or to the downside, a little bit something And in the third case example is where the market opens and we trend and trend again on day two. So those are the three unique strategies you will see and need to employ on a day two trend. Now, the important thing to understand is that there are very key characteristics that you will see early on that will identify which one of the three of the day types Remember what I said to you in the beginning. This trade strategy requires utmost patience. It requires understanding of what has occurred in terms of the psychology of both buyers and sellers in the previous session. If you can understand this strategy from that perspective, you will very quickly realize that patience will pay when it comes to day two trend. Now, the first thing we're going to deal with is some of the characteristics you will typically find on this day type. Now, the marketing example that we're going to use is the Eurodollar FX and the ... The day type that we are going to discuss is effectively the inside day. Now remember we noted that that was where the market fails to break the previous day's high and remains within the top quarter. Now to bear in mind, put things into context, in the Euro dollar the previous day we had a relatively aggressive trend up day and the market topped out at 108.80. That was our high from the previous day and that is where we're going to pay attention to first hand.

The first thing you need to know is that trade opportunity number one is that there of the previous extreme, in other words. If the market trended to the upside as it did in this example, or to the downside as in some examples, there is a high probability we will retest that extreme very early on in the session. Note what I said. It's very early on in the session. What you want to pay key attention to and what you find particularly with the currency markets is that if in the Asian session the market has failed to test the previous comes in online around eight o'clock, there tends to be a high probability we retest the previous day's high early on, as in the example we've provided. So, very important to understand, our first trade opportunity is to determine, have we won retest of the previous day's extreme? More importantly, if we take on that trade strategy, what location are we taking it from? And that is crucial, guys, very carefully listen. If we are, let's use a nice little example, so this is the previous day, let's say the European session opens and we're opening, let's say the range between, or the distance from the high to where we're currently trading is 20 pips. Now what you have to say to yourself is, let's say the previous day's range was So what you're saying is, in terms of trade location, are you being too aggressive on a day-two trend? Now, again, this is all relative, but what I would say to you, the key to taking on this first trade opportunity is to say to yourself, if you are executing in a good trade location, in other words, if you are being a buyer in a good area, in other words, the market has had somewhat of a pullback. If you're executing in a good area, you are allowing yourself to take advantage of the high probability that we're going to retest the high. So trade location is important when coming to this first setup. If you are buying, for instance, 15 to 20 pips off of the previous day's high, you are being a little bit too aggressive based on trade location. So trade strategy number one is all about trade location. That's our first option so let's see how this trade played out I'm gonna roll the tape back a little bit so we can see how it played out so note now the European sessions opened up We're trading around the 107.45 remember bear in mind Our previous day's high is 108, so we can straight away see that we are 55 pips below the previous day's extreme.

Now note, I said to you, in the three examples, one, we have a hangover day Two, we have a hangover day which just extends the previous day's range and fails. And three, we have a trend, trend day. Now again, note, in terms of probability of outcome, we are least likely to see a trend, trend day, whereas we are most likely to see an inside hangover day. So again, work within the probability. If the probability is very low that we're going to have a trend, trend day, well then don't be looking to be too aggressive at the previous day's extreme. Likewise, if there's a high probability that we could at least retest the previous day's high, then we want to be executing aggressively on a pullback early on. Now as you can see in the tape, notice how the markets very early on decided to go in and retest above the previous day's highs. So we can see the market opened, moved from 45s all the way up to 90s, and now we're seeing two-way trade between the buyers and sellers. An early retest of the previous day's high area, we can see that not only have buyers backed off their first time, but we've also seen a little bit of response from the sellers to step in. Let's just move this a little bit forward and see what happens when we retest, note, the crucial previous high of the day. This is the key area that you want to focus on, guys, is the previous high. In this example, in a downtrend, the previous low. So the previous high will unlock a lot of information early on as to which one of the three day types you can expect. Failure and it's all about the hangover options. Success and aggression and initiative above the previous day's high and we could have the potential for a trend, trend day. It's that simple, guys. We've got one, we've got an early execution looking for the retest of the previous day's high if we are in a good location. Two, what do we do at the previous day's extreme, whether it's the high or the low, as that will determine whether or not we are going to trend up for the rest of the day or continue in a hangover distribution day type. Now, note how the market is very early on distributing. We saw a little bit of buy side action early on and we then distributed before the market now sold off and has now done the entire day's range.

Straight away we rule out the idea of trend trend and we go into full scale hangover day. Trade opportunity number two, which is very, very key, is looking for, again, we're looking now for a price response in the trend of, in the direction of the trend. Now I'm going to show you what I mean by that. In other words, so let's say the previous day we have a nice trend update. Now what we're looking for is we're looking for as this market comes lower Let's just change this color as this market comes lower down the page and slowly drifting drifting into the previous day's range The moment we get some very aggressive Responsive buying okay the moment we get that responsive buy side price action in the market where we see You know some tail some initiative. You know some maybe some hidden tails or some real aggressive reversal price action At that point, we want to look to execute aggressively, looking for the market then to rotate with the short-term trend to the upside. So what we're looking for is we're looking for any kind of momentum to the downside. that we can get onto. So the minute we see any momentum counter the short-term trend, bang, that's when we want to get involved and that's when we want to execute and put our stop below that point where we enter and we see that aggressive type reversal price action. Now note, as you can see on this day type, remember, it's day two trend, we are within a short-term uptrend. Notice how the market has got two unique distributions. So almost like a double distribution. So straight away you're going to say to yourself, how can a market that is relatively aggressively bullish to the upside, how can it start leaving all of a sudden a lower traded volume area when the trend is to the upside? So again, a very early identifier, but remember, some of the key characteristics to pay attention to on a day two trend is that one, we see a lot of two-way trade. Okay, so expect a lot of two-way trade, expect a lot of overlap trade, and you can see that if you look in this portion here, look how much overlap is occurring between all the TPO's.

In other words, if you want to short this market, that's fine, but don't short in here. Okay, you're short in there, you're taking on a lot of perceived risk. right? If you want to be short, short passively, let the market come to you and give you short side opportunity. If you want to be long, be long on the aggressive side. So bang, we can see this momentum coming in. Bang, bang, bang. We look to buy, buy, buy. Be aggressive on the buy side. Why? Because it's with the short term perceived trend. Now note, let's pause this there. What's happened here? We can see that the market has been distributing. We've had a So we've had a double distribution day type, and all of a sudden we can see the market has shown momentum counter trend. Now remember what I said to you. Strategy number two. The minute we get a price response in the direction of the trend, you know it's once we see these buyers step back in, we want to look to execute aggressive long trades move back towards value. So as we can see the E print came lower, we saw aggression, the F print came lower, all of a sudden we get a little bit of a buying tail, we get the inside candle with the G print and we suddenly start making a series of higher lows before the market looks to rotate back towards value. Now remember what I said to you, in the second trade opportunity, the key is to be willing to hold onto the trade without stop below the point where the initiative is taken. More importantly, we're looking for a relatively large move in terms of target. We don't want to be getting out of this trade until the market has paid us what it is worth. In other words, if this was you know because this is with the trend we would expect the bounce on this to at least return back up towards where you know we were previously accepting value so again just putting yourself in this mindset that you are with the trend that you are deserving of more So that is our day two trend. It's a wonderfully simple set up and if you're patient with it, if you really just take the time to think about the set up and the psychology behind what's occurred, you're so likely to be more patient on these day two trend days.
