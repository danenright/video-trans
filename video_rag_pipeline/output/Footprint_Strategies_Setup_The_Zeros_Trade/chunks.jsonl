Okay, so you'll see this more often in gold, the S&P, oil, especially compared to thicker markets where very rarely you'll see this unless there's extreme volatility, extreme momentum and likely the liquidity that usually features in these thick markets isn't there. So we ask ourselves, when we see this quick rip through on the ladder and we notice that when the market does trade back and then very quickly turns and reverses, continues the same in the same direction you can ask ourselves is there a pattern of this auction activity that leaves that leaves a sort of a pattern on the footprint that we can observe and replicate and catch okay so just before I continue here's a very you know very clean example in the S&P so we know what we're talking about essentially down here we had a trading And we very, very quickly traded up through this area and we formed this footprint. As you can see, we have all these bids that lifted right through all these prices. And conversely, there was no one really hitting the bid on the way. There was no one trying to hit into the bid as we were lifting. And that leaves all these clusters of zeros that you see on the way here. this area here as well was also essentially zeros, but the market very quickly just rotated, scooped them up and then carried on. Okay, so it's essentially this area, this very low volume area compared to this area above that we're very much interested in, because just by pure observation on the lander and using no other tools, we've noticed that when the market does come back to the highs of this, if you call this the sort of level, to the highs, it will very often", "transcript": "okay hello everyone thank you for joining me on the very first video of this footprint series so in this video we're gonna first look at something called the zeros trade now jumping right in we're first gonna look at the origins of the zeroes trade how did we arrive to actually trade this setup was the first sort of the purity that they're just a pure observation the The zero trade begins with or rather happens when we very quickly auction through an area on the ladder okay, so you might even be sitting there and then suddenly the ladder just rips right through the through the screen and You know very often we pull back to these To these areas we come back to them and then we bounce right off Now through simple observation we can see that there's a very strong propensity for thinner markets to do this.

So you want to run momentum. Do you scale out when it's high momentum? Do you just hold all your science to target? That's perhaps based based You know, that's up to you But what we've essentially used here is a setup that gets you in without wasting much time But giving yourself an extremely good risk reward and if you find yourself placing these trades with very tight scored very large targets and not much opportunity to mess about in between, then that's a very good situation to be in.

So today we're going to look at Footprint Setup 2, something called The Absorption Wall. Curiously enough, this is one of the trades where everyone on the floor, a lot of traders do look for the exact same kind of features, but they all have perhaps a different way of looking at it, they have a different way of calling it, they have a different way of sort of noticing it. Some people like to do it purely directly on the ladder, some people, you know, like myself, like to do it by combining it by using a ladder and then checking you know doing a bit of both but essentially they are the mirror image they are the the activity of course that you always see on the ladder will show up on the footprint and so on so it is a very nice and simple way to keep track of these kind of trades okay so jumping right in we're going to first look at as usual the origins of the trade where did the sort of the initial seed of the idea start from It all starts from really looking deeply at the larger market participant.

But again, this is why you have that tight screw tight risk reward but while you're in the trade if this is starting to occur then you should think about essentially exiting because the optimal trade the optimal model is a very aggressive continuation lower and there shouldn't be much time for you to even start thinking about whether it will or will not go okay which in a way makes it slightly easier to manage in trade and now if we're talking about targets where to take the trade You should think about how it incorporates into your own style of taking this kind of break It's sort of how you want to run breakouts. So you want to run momentum. Do you scale out when it's high momentum? Do you just hold all your science to target? That's perhaps based based You know, that's up to you But what we've essentially used here is a setup that gets you in without wasting much time But giving yourself an extremely good risk reward and if you find yourself placing these trades with very tight scored very large targets and not much opportunity to mess about in between, then that's a very good situation to be in. Okay guys, that's it for the first video. I hope you've enjoyed it and I'll see you back for some more. Thank you very much. Okay, hello everyone. Thank you for joining me again. So today we're going to look at Footprint Setup 2, something called The Absorption Wall. Curiously enough, this is one of the trades where everyone on the floor, a lot of traders do look for the exact same kind of features, but they all have perhaps a different way of looking at it, they have a different way of calling it, they have a different way of sort of noticing it. Some people like to do it purely directly on the ladder, some people, you know, like myself, like to do it by combining it by using a ladder and then checking you know doing a bit of both but essentially they are the mirror image they are the the activity of course that you always see on the ladder will show up on the footprint and so on so it is a very nice and simple way to keep track of these kind of trades okay so jumping right in we're going to first look at as usual the origins of the trade where did the sort of the initial seed of the idea start from It all starts from really looking deeply at the larger market participant. What's he doing? What's he trading? When does he come in?", "ocr_text": null, "visual_caption": null, "metadata": {"chunk_idx": 6, "frame_refs": ["output/Footprint_Strategies_Setup_The_Zeros_Trade/frames/scene_0001_end.jpg", "output/Footprint_Strategies_Setup_The_Zeros_Trade/frames/scene_0002_start.jpg", "output/Footprint_Strategies_Setup_The_Zeros_Trade/frames/scene_0002_mid.jpg", "output/Footprint_Strategies_Setup_The_Zeros_Trade/frames/scene_0002_end.jpg", "output/Footprint_Strategies_Setup_The_Zeros_Trade/frames/scene_0003_start.jpg"]}}

So before we sort of talk about something, you know, more about this, we should recall market auction theory, okay? And specifically we should recall what are passive and aggressive participants, okay? Using a limit orders and just on the next slide. I have a Burned ladder are taken on a random day. So just continue the idea. We're talking about a passive trader especially large passive traders who would not come in and Let's say he's a buyer. He would not come in and take the next price take 50s He would not lift that price what he will do is stack his offers At 49 47 46 or combination of both spread his orders out But what this means is he's looking to get filled passively by leaving limit orders and he wants for the market to step down and someone to sell it to him. Now that is on one side of the scale. On the other side of the scale is the aggressive trader, the one who takes the prices, okay. So he's looking to take out 50s, he buys everything here, he takes out 51s, he takes out 156 lot and we keep trading. is actually the sort of the in-between sort of large traded is the mix of both We're looking for the participant who doesn't actually hit that market to lift the next price is not the the pure aggressive trader Yet what he does is he reloads the inside bid Okay, or the the bid underneath the inside bid now just to clarify What is the inside bid or conversely the inside offer it is the best bid or offer available? It is the first one, you know, closest to the bid offer spread, essentially. So here the inside bid is 49s and the best offer is 50s, essentially. And while we're looking for certain market conditions where the passive buyer steps up to not buy, perhaps, let's say an accumulator position down here, he is directly putting and taking all the orders directly at the inside bid.

And then they just absolutely hit that market. And then this buyer accumulated all the, you know, all the selling. The shorts hit that market, they all puked, and you know, that loss sure is already immediately breaking on site. But essentially what we're looking for, what the commonality is, is that you're looking again for the classic breakout conditions. We're looking for tight ranges. We're looking for vulnerable structure to target. we're looking for a shift from low volatility to high volatility and this kind of trade of course should be taken in the context of a continuation trade so what this means is is that you should not really take this trade let's say we have again our range and there's a very strong daily low with multiple you know multiple levels perhaps a profile level just here and between the range break and level there's four ticks yeah four ticks is Again, it depends. Four takes in the US Treasuries is completely different to four takes in the Bund, but again, consider what kind of space you have as good targets in terms of risk-award. The risk you'll take on this kind of trade is actually very minimal, but often you very much like to have a very tight range, and there's absolutely no volume clusters or volume areas anywhere, and the only next big level in, let's say for example, the Bunds is like 25 ticks away which gives you an excellent risk reward. So understand we want to look at this as a sort of continuation trade because We're not getting in at the break. We're getting in somewhere like halfway or a quarter of the way That's just sort of the next leg of the move. Okay, so as mentioned previously the aim of the setup is to Join the continuation trade as a breakout and this is especially true Of markets prone to the no pullback breakouts and what does that mean? No pullback? No pullback That's exactly what I meant by locking the door behind them. This is a very common feature of burns, annoyingly, a lot of the time, and treasuries. Often times they will break out, hold one price, two prices, continue, hold the next price, two prices, and then continue.

We had equities bidding, bonds coming off, and in fact, the entire German curve was being offered this day very strongly, and it didn't seem like much of a session if you tracked from the open. backs really in the blend apart from a few here you know the thicker markets the short and German curve was even more offered it barely even came off the lows.

So in this situation you know we're looking for shorts and we're looking for sort of large participants to come in and we're interested in seeing what will happen on the break at this level at 75.08 and of course because you know it's just sort of offering coming in and we want to join in we're at the very least going to target perhaps these poor lows which you'd expect to trade through and a very nice target if we can get the yesterday's low you know at the 89s giving you know a great space for the market to trade and this is what we mean by continuation trade that there's very nice space very good reason for the market to offer lower so what actually happened now this isn't perhaps the cleanest and the next example i'll give is perhaps a cleaner one but this is the kind of this is the kind of sort of activity that you'll expect to see. Now all the examples have been given in terms of a buyer coming in holding the bid and so on has been describing a break higher. In this case we're actually trading lower and what will what will happen is that there's a seller who will reload the price in which case we're looking at this side of the footprint on the right side because what happens is if the you know the market's coming off and if there's buyers they will try and lift the offer okay they're trading on this side, they're lifting into this side of the footprint. And what you could observe here is that we have this staggeredness where there's someone trying to lift this price here at 05s and there's a seller just sat there at 05s just taking all of his orders. And this is where observing the ladder at the same time is very useful because this exchange, this pace, this activity between the reloading price is very aggressive. you can sense how they're reloading this price very aggressively, very fast. There's pace, there's a lot of activity. The exchange is very, very quick, okay? And what essentially happens is here again, this is the price we're looking at, 0.5s. So what later happened is, you see how this sort of sticks out like a sore thumb? We had a seller absolutely just reloading this price and just took all of this buying that came in. And this is what I mean by not being a 100% pure textbook because we did have the rotation back where Burns didn't actually hold the next price the next price but it did hold it within 2-3 ticks and eventually we traded through, came onto the poor lows and came off right into yesterday's low. But the reason I included this trade is because you must understand what kind of", "transcript": "backs really in the blend apart from a few here you know the thicker markets the short and German curve was even more offered it barely even came off the lows. So in this situation you know we're looking for shorts and we're looking for sort of large participants to come in and we're interested in seeing what will happen on the break at this level at 75.08 and of course because you know it's just sort of offering coming in and we want to join in we're at the very least going to target perhaps these poor lows which you'd expect to trade through and a very nice target if we can get the yesterday's low you know at the 89s giving you know a great space for the market to trade and this is what we mean by continuation trade that there's very nice space very good reason for the market to offer lower so what actually happened now this isn't perhaps the cleanest and the next example i'll give is perhaps a cleaner one but this is the kind of this is the kind of sort of activity that you'll expect to see. Now all the examples have been given in terms of a buyer coming in holding the bid and so on has been describing a break higher. In this case we're actually trading lower and what will what will happen is that there's a seller who will reload the price in which case we're looking at this side of the footprint on the right side because what happens is if the you know the market's coming off and if there's buyers they will try and lift the offer okay they're trading on this side, they're lifting into this side of the footprint. And what you could observe here is that we have this staggeredness where there's someone trying to lift this price here at 05s and there's a seller just sat there at 05s just taking all of his orders. And this is where observing the ladder at the same time is very useful because this exchange, this pace, this activity between the reloading price is very aggressive. you can sense how they're reloading this price very aggressively, very fast. There's pace, there's a lot of activity. The exchange is very, very quick, okay? And what essentially happens is here again, this is the price we're looking at, 0.5s. So what later happened is, you see how this sort of sticks out like a sore thumb? We had a seller absolutely just reloading this price and just took all of this buying that came in.

Okay, so again this is we're going to look at the footprint frame by frame. So here we have 99s and we can see first of all break. What happens? There's a reloader here. The sellers, and he's just taking out one price at 0.4s. Okay, so you're already picking up, you're observing this as we do it. And what happens next? We trade higher, okay?

Reloading again, next price. And this is what I mean about locking the door. We're moving up, we're moving and there's just absolutely no chance for it to come back and we keep trading higher, okay?

You should have a very tight stop and again, just like the zero straight you're trying to go for a binary binary scenario Because either the reloader will continue and still be there and carry the market higher Or he'll finish and then very quickly the market will come back just to fill out this lower volume area relatively to the you know low volume relative to the sort of the high activity that participated here and Therefore you want to be out very quickly and this is the argument that perhaps tight stop are not always Stupid or dangerous and even large stops may even be quite dangerous because if this reload is here and carries on and we're expecting that the price will just absolutely not come back while he's there you absolutely want to have a tight stop in case something quickly you know changes and so on but you want to have a tight stop because if you have a large stop we will just retrace and eventually you'll get your stop taken but you've taken 15 takes risk instead of three or four and you know if the if the reloader keeps carrying on driving the price will never come back and then your stop is fine and that essentially creates very tight risk rewards.

What will often happen is that the guy who will reload here will probably not be done and the market will you know back off, he will step up, he'll back off and then he'll step up again and what this does is actually you can actually end up trailing your stop as well so you know if he shows up and he's fairly aggressive he the market will keep trading higher and then he can very simply you know keep your stop perhaps here and you know let's say he's now absorbing at 0.6s just trail your stop just underneath it let's say this trade moves higher and then here's another absorption you know reloading that goes on at Especially if you want to do this fairly aggressively, okay If you don't let risk the sort of the small trap just to get to shake now the trading keep on going if that's perhaps If you're not looking for that sheer aggressiveness Which you can do is perhaps say as long as we keep seeing this this this buyer pick up these These burns.

Now let's finish the video off with a quick summary So initially we looked at the trade idea We're looked at how a sudden flow or information change causes a large participant to step up and change from becoming a You know, he changes from becoming pure passive to you know on relative scales become more aggressive and then this his participation his constant reloading you know carries the breakout that much further and what you want to how do you want to execute on these countries well you want to get filled with limit order with the reloader and you want to have a stop very close to your entry because the mark will either go consistently higher shallow pullbacks or completely retrace and then you should be out and again in terms of managing you can add a trailer stop take it if it seems the reload is there and conversely if you seek to add you can add once we've you know as the as the as the reloader reloads this price and if you're willing to go for this kind of sort of more aggressive style you can just add with him as he goes in and then targets as mentioned you know this dependent on your how you like to trade your breakouts how you planned to what to do with yours you know with your size what you plan to do with your position once we go to the next area of importance and we define this by let's say strong daily highs market profile areas and so on okay everyone that's it for video two i hope you've enjoyed it come back for more videos we have many more to go through very interesting ones and i hope to see you in", "transcript": "sort of obvious where eventually we did end up stalling here and the buyer just you know committed bought way more up here than he did down here making this look like a little smaller activity but you know essentially you started trading in this in this area here and and as mentioned previously in this trade funnily enough you know we did trade a bit higher and then you know the market turned again on on on risk and we did come through And this is what I mean, when the market did come through and the reload did disappear, the market did this very quickly.

Now let's finish the video off with a quick summary So initially we looked at the trade idea We're looked at how a sudden flow or information change causes a large participant to step up and change from becoming a You know, he changes from becoming pure passive to you know on relative scales become more aggressive and then this his participation his constant reloading you know carries the breakout that much further and what you want to how do you want to execute on these countries well you want to get filled with limit order with the reloader and you want to have a stop very close to your entry because the mark will either go consistently higher shallow pullbacks or completely retrace and then you should be out and again in terms of managing you can add a trailer stop take it if it seems the reload is there and conversely if you seek to add you can add once we've you know as the as the as the reloader reloads this price and if you're willing to go for this kind of sort of more aggressive style you can just add with him as he goes in and then targets as mentioned you know this dependent on your how you like to trade your breakouts how you planned to what to do with yours you know with your size what you plan to do with your position once we go to the next area of importance and we define this by let's say strong daily highs market profile areas and so on okay everyone that's it for video two i hope you've enjoyed it come back for more videos we have many more to go through very interesting ones and i hope to see you in", "ocr_text": null, "visual_caption": null, "metadata": {"chunk_idx": 17}}

Why? Because, well, my predisposed opinion is that because of X amount of factors this apple is red this market is going to go down okay and all of a sudden when you enforce that into your belief system guess what yes it might work okay but time and time again it's not going to work why because when it is that obvious it's not just obvious for you it's obvious for almost every single other participant in the market so stop looking at the apple as being red start looking at the Apple as being yellow, right? So when you look at the markets, say to yourself, what made this market rally today? Not, I knew it would rally, but what made it rally? What were the key facts that told me, or that hinted to me, that rally was on? Was there high volume? Was there volatility? Was there a breakout of a triple top on a key level that we've held for the last 12 months? What was it that gave the clue that rally was on? In other words, what fact?

The information I'm going to give you in the next couple of moments, you're going to begin to realize that breakout trading, whilst it's seemingly obvious, it's actually filled with some really big pitfalls in which most traders fall into. What I am going to say is that if you do follow the really process-based approach increase the probability of your success with breakouts tremendously. Okay now before we move on to that I just want to talk very briefly about this concept of right and wrong.

I've seen traders do what I feel is seemingly the wrong thing at the wrong time and make a lot of these things, make a lot of profit. Okay, I've seen traders do the right things at the right time and take a big loss. Okay, so there is no right or wrong in trading. If you can start off by believing in that principle, you're really on the right process to a growth mindset. Now, the reason I want you to get away from this idea of right and wrong is because when you start to think things as right or wrong, you naturally start to create a bias. Okay? And when you create a bias, you can no longer have a growth mindset. obviously a red apple, it doesn't matter how much I argue with you, it doesn't matter how much I try and prove it to you that it's not red, you've got a bias. You know what red is, you're never going to believe my side, it doesn't matter how much objectivity I can show you, you're just not going to be willing to listen and learn. Now that's Now the second thing is, and it came out of the mental session, was this concept of an exact approach. A lot of young traders, even a lot of developed traders, are really going in search of an exact approach. They almost want some form of a 100% if A equals B, then do C. Now unfortunately guys, we are discretionary traders, we are not algorithmic traders. an exact process, then you need to obviously look more towards an algorithmic type of approach.

There are certain rules governing algorithmic trading, there are certain rules governing discretionary trading, there are certain rules governing hedge funds, there are certain rules governing institutional trading.

Because there's many participants. Okay, so that's the first thing to understand about breakout rates. It's very, very obvious. Now, the reason why most people tend to fail Okay, most people don't understand the basic logic behind what creates a breakout trade Okay, and because they don't know what creates the basic elements of a breakout trade They don't know how to execute in terms of timing. Okay, so what ends up happening if I draw a basic example We have this really key resistance great breakout level notes nice dark blue line because we've identified as key resistance Okay, people get long goes up tests fails comes back. Let's stop out Maybe they buy it again on a little fail break, stops down, comes back. Maybe they buy it one last time at the high, stops, starts to turn over, and they give up. They've taken the loss for the day, probably stopped down on the day. Eventually, later in the afternoon, the market breaks, and we get the breakout.

OK, and that's where the analysis ends. That's where the real honest, objective approach ends now. What the whole strategy-based templates teach you is that that's not good enough. You don't just go and say, okay, well, that didn't work. We look at all the various elements, every single element around this breakout, from time, relative changes, delta, all these things, we look at them and we break them down one by one by one because that's where we pick up on the subtleties. Now, this is the reason why so many people end up failing because they don't know how to time a breakout. before we get on to me showing you the key principles of how to time a breakout. Let's just discuss something else that's quite important and pertinent to breakouts. The first is the auction process. In order to understand an auction process, or a breakout, sorry, you have to understand how an auction process works. Let's go back to basic elementary stuff. Sorry, I don't know, I go through these things over and over again, but the whole point is that you can understand the philosophies, the principles, become better at breakout trades. So the basic premise is that's a discount,", "transcript": "should be a breakout. So we're all good at identifying it, but guess what, if you can see a chart, so can every other retail trader in the world, so can every other algorithm in the world, so can every other banker in the world, everyone can see a breakout. public knowledge. Now, I hope straight away you're going, ah, okay, I didn't realize that. Because guess what? If a breakout is public, obvious knowledge, then it means that there's likely to be a lot of noise. Why? Because there's many participants. Okay, so that's the first thing to understand about breakout rates. It's very, very obvious. Now, the reason why most people tend to fail Okay, most people don't understand the basic logic behind what creates a breakout trade Okay, and because they don't know what creates the basic elements of a breakout trade They don't know how to execute in terms of timing. Okay, so what ends up happening if I draw a basic example We have this really key resistance great breakout level notes nice dark blue line because we've identified as key resistance Okay, people get long goes up tests fails comes back. Let's stop out Maybe they buy it again on a little fail break, stops down, comes back. Maybe they buy it one last time at the high, stops, starts to turn over, and they give up. They've taken the loss for the day, probably stopped down on the day. Eventually, later in the afternoon, the market breaks, and we get the breakout. Now what most people do in this situation, they go and say, Ah, OK, it was a bad breakout. Yeah, it was a bad breakout. Didn't break there, didn't break there, it wasn't a really good breakout level.

So the basic premise is that's a discount, and that's a premium, and ultimately what happens is the market will tend to find fair value within that price range until such a point that this fair value is no longer, that should say longer, valid. Now the moment, and only at that moment, Will initiative be taken in one direction or the other and that's the key that if there's one thing you take away from that a breakout I'm gonna write this Break sorry guys apologies for spelling.

We've spoken about the three obviously participants. So we've got the influential participants, we've got the algos, and we've got the speculators. Now what you've got to say to yourself, who can create initiative? Well, it's not the speculative. Definitely not the speculative participants. They can try, they're going to fail. Not the algorithms. Why? Because well, by nature, algorithms are very exact in their process. So, for instance, if they do try and go for the break and it starts to offer, they'll all be scaling up on the way down already. So the nature of algorithms means that they won't likely be able to hold initiative. So it's only one participant, which is the influential participant, that can create initiative. Now until such a time that that influential participant steps in to initiate, to move the market into price discovery mode beyond fair value, you will not get a breakout. So I hope you understand that, because that's the premise of it. Now, what I'm going to show you in the next couple of slides is I'm going to talk all about this concept of timing, because this is the single most important principle when it comes to a breakout.

Now, before we move on to that, let's just talk about some of the other principles that do underline a breakout. So the first one, in order for a breakout to be successful, all participants, okay, participants. Will be in agreement in other words in order for a breakout to be successful We need obviously number one the initiative Okay, but what we don't want is we don't want someone suddenly Responding on the other side. Okay, so we don't want someone providing liquidity on the other side on a breakout Okay, so we need all participants all of them influential algorithmic and speculative we need them all in agreement Okay now The next thing is, obviously, how do we determine now our key support and resistance? We're going to come back to the timing, but how do we determine key support and resistance? We spoke about this quite a lot over the last couple of units. We also did speak about this quite extensively in Unit 3. I'm not going to go over it in great detail, just very simply. We can identify a breakout by the break. volume, delta, volatility, okay. So if we have all four of those high volume, you know, quite an aggressive, you know, in terms of time, quite an aggressive move, a delta within the direction of the break, as well as an increased pick-up in volatility, those signal a really good break of resistance and support. Now, what we're interested in this entire strategy session is we want two trades here. One, we want to be able to position ourselves We want to be able to add once we've got the break. And that's what the strategy session's about. It's about being able to execute twice on the single strategy of breakout trading. Now, some of the key support and resistance areas that you can look at. Now again, guys, I'm going to give you a couple of examples, but this is by no means an exhaustive list.

So if the prices are kind of moving like this, like this, and something just goes like that, that's velocity. So velocity expansion, and then obviously imbalances. So these are the five timing, we're going to call them timing clues. They're the clues. They tell us that ultimately something's changed, and potentially this influential participant stepped in. I'm gonna explain it to you with a breakout graphic so if I can I'm just gonna use the left side of the board so if we have our breakout again we're gonna use resistance okay so if we have our breakout obviously our first one absorption so the market might have formed a flag which is quite typical before a break so we get this flag market starts to turn back over and just at that high point we start to see the buyers absorbing so we see or absorbing is one of the most consistent ones that you tend to see on breakouts. So the buyer's absorbing ahead of the break. Now what that's going to look like in terms of Delta, potentially a lot of dark blue. Generally it will be a blue color in nature. Why? Because the buyer starts when he's starting to become aggressive, there's not likely to be much selling liquidity there. By the time the buyers do become more aggressive, they're actually going to lift through the breakout zone. by our absorption, rather than by us being aggressive initially. Now, the second M is obviously the delta, as I mentioned there. Okay, you're going to suddenly see a shift in the color, so what you'll typically see, if this is maybe the bar just before a break, you might have been seeing a whole bunch of light colors, light colors, light colors, and suddenly just before the break you get this really, really dark color.

Okay, a nice dark blue or something, again a nice visual representation of the sudden That's coming from the initiative being taken by potential big participants Now the third is obviously relative changes in either volume or price variance. So again What you will see a lot of the time is Within this maybe consolidation zone or even absorption auctioning zone. You might not see a great deal going on And all of a sudden you'll see the volume sort of ticking across ticking across maybe 1,000 lots every couple of minutes And suddenly, just before the break, you suddenly see it move to 3,000 contracts. Again, another very, very important clue that something has shifted. The game has changed, and we're about to respond in terms of price. Obviously, the price, again, this is another clue you're going to see. I will show you an example of this. The variance of price changes. And then suddenly you get a 12 tick rotation. This is a real clue again that something has shifted, the initiative is now being taken. Obviously that ties in with velocity in terms of expansion. So again velocity isn't necessarily directional, be careful to note that. Just like volatility doesn't mean trend, it doesn't mean that because there's velocity It doesn't mean because of volatility or velocity that prices are going up or down, okay, just simply means that they're moving over a greater range, okay. And then the last one is obviously an imbalance, so sometimes what we rarely see just before the break is some sort of an imbalance. Again, the imbalance you're more likely to see when the market isn't necessarily beginning the breakout at the extreme. It might be beginning the breakout here, maybe the initiative starts and within that we initially get some form of an imbalance. Okay, but the most important thing, in this early example where the breakout begins early, this is obviously giving you a far better opportunity to execute for a much bigger winner in terms of a breakout. Why? Because it's showing you the signal, the timing clue, very early on. But you have to be aware of the five different types of timing clues. And there they are. Absorption, delta, relative changes in volume or price variance. velocity in terms of price and imbalances. Okay, now let's go look at some practical examples.

And that's why it's so important to know your key levels. It's so important. And that's also why we have got our blue lines in place. Okay, so we put those blue lines because sometimes the market might begin the process of a breakout very early on. Now, let's take a little look at the key signal we got you. Now, the first, I'm gonna bring your attention to the bottom. Let's look at the volume dynamic so we can see not a great deal going on. Market began the process of rotating a little bit lower. And again, I will show you this in an example, in a live trading example, but what I want you to focus on more now is the clue. So we can see very clearly, the clue was the market tried to go backward and straight away someone sold very, very aggressively, so there was a really big seller. Note, once that buyer identified the seller, now it just hard begins the process of thinning out. the seller become far more intentional and aggressive. So we got the clue, there's our clue, and the market suddenly responded in a very, very, very aggressive manner. Okay, obviously you note some of the imbalances with some of the zeros, some more imbalances, and ultimately a very aggressive wash down. Okay, now some of the key sort of factors that we pay attention to, obviously, we want to see that pick up volume in delta. In terms of execution, all we're simply looking for is we're looking for that clue. Once that clue comes in, we're looking for an opportunity to enter now. The best part about a clue is the stop. Okay, because if we have a clue, where does the stop go? It's very simple. We should not be clearing that clue. So it's very simple. This is why breakout trading can be so lucrative because you've got maximum risk-award. Okay, this is probably hands down one of the best risk-award trade strategies you can learn but only if you're willing to learn the clues. Okay, so we get the clue. We try and execute wherever we best can, probably within that absorption. 320 contracts traded. Once we get the clue we're short, and I think the breakout came somewhere in and around that price. We will obviously see that a little bit later on. Okay, so that's our first example of a clue. Our next example is in the gold market.

Okay, now some of the key sort of factors that we pay attention to, obviously, we want to see that pick up volume in delta. In terms of execution, all we're simply looking for is we're looking for that clue. Once that clue comes in, we're looking for an opportunity to enter now. The best part about a clue is the stop. Okay, because if we have a clue, where does the stop go? It's very simple. We should not be clearing that clue. So it's very simple. This is why breakout trading can be so lucrative because you've got maximum risk-award. Okay, this is probably hands down one of the best risk-award trade strategies you can learn but only if you're willing to learn the clues. Okay, so we get the clue. We try and execute wherever we best can, probably within that absorption. 320 contracts traded. Once we get the clue we're short, and I think the breakout came somewhere in and around that price. We will obviously see that a little bit later on. Okay, so that's our first example of a clue. Our next example is in the gold market. This time obviously we have a little bit more of the traditional type flag breakout, the one you're all familiar with.

Okay, so there's your absorption 163 lots. Note, one seller sold into it, so you got filled. So someone reloaded, buyer reloaded, absorbed.

So that was the Now again, this is our clue. Our execution will probably take place somewhere in here where we can get liquidity away and we want to be in ahead of the break and this is where the break occurs. Okay, so we can see the break occurs just above that 92 and a half. Notice the whole bunch of stops on the break and continuation. Also notice the volume pick up as well as the delta and the delta on the day. It is that easy, guys, you just have to learn to observe the clues from the markets, rather than trying to anticipate, rather than trying to second guess yourself, okay? You're simply waiting for that clue, bang, when that clue's in, you execute. Okay, now, what we're going to do, we're going to have a look at one more example. This is now in the gold again on the 5th of December, again a five minute rotation. Now, this is the second strategy, so obviously we've spoken about the two types of execution. One is on the clue ahead of the break, and we want to be in on the break. The second is then, once we've had a breakout, the first pullback, okay? So we've identified a good breakout, we wait for that first pullback, and we can see, very simply, obviously Mark has a nice exhaustion low, we've spoken about those in previous units, tries to take a breather, comes back and tests, obviously. a pocket positioning or high area of liquidity that was previously provided and holds that point as resistance, not just once but twice and three times before continuing lower.

Now, a breakout trade strategy by definition is all about price discovery. Now, when a market goes into price discovery, it's not a one-off feature, okay, so it's not like we break, pull back, and then stop, and then come back down, okay. Yes, when that happens, we have a failed support and resistance, but more often than And we're more than likely, very high probability, gonna always extend and continue the function of price discovery, okay?

Nothing really going through the market. Really, really light in terms of volume. Not a great deal going on. You can see the market comes down, and all of a sudden, we start to see someone selling, but equally, someone reloading. Okay, and this is what we call buying absorption.

Now, let's move on to our next example. This is going to be a breakout now in the cable. Again, remember this is obviously mid-range. So you can see this is why it's crucial. Because I want to show you guys, I want to dispel that idea that breakouts occur just in extremes. They don't. They can't extreme. They can occur from anywhere. And that's why we have the clues like price, velocity shifting. So important, you always do analysis, you always have those blue lines so that when that velocity shifts, you can simply execute. So what you're going to see now is the cable sitting in a relatively sideways range. Note, nothing going on. Nice light colors, zero change in the delta. We do, however, have a negative delta on the day, so there's quite a negative delta on the day, but prices are sitting quite close to the high of the day, which is quite fascinating. Now, note what's just happened here. Straight away, the markets come up and we've seen a relatively aggressive buyer. Now, this is a real subtle clue because something's changed here. If I just saw this now, I'd be really switched on. It doesn't necessarily mean buy or sell, but something's changed because suddenly a buyer not just take 200 contracts but he's also then bought 123 so really really aggressive intent taken from a buyer get what happens to price it goes in the opposite direction okay that was our subtle clue now you're going to see how this plays out in the next couple of minutes ultimately we start to see a little bit of an imbalance form in the middle of this rotation these are obviously five minute rotations suddenly we start Okay, so we got the signal early on and all of a sudden the market begins a process of initiative in the opposite direction Okay, note the imbalances again. So we had imbalances higher up, imbalances lower down and suddenly the market begins a very rapid process of unwind. Okay, I just want to get back to that break point. So again, just note guys It's it's not always that a breakout is going to be suddenly huge or big. Okay, obviously note We did have a little bit of an outside candle Note the change in volume, note the shift in Delta. That was a real clue on that previous rotation. It was a sudden shift in the game. It was a game-changer clue before we got the spike. Obviously that was 30 ticks in the cable market. It did extend a little bit lower.

If you adopt this strategy and this strategy alone, no doubt you will become extremely consistent or a lot more consistent than you currently are with a rule based structured approach. Let's get to the template and let's have a look through the various components. First up, obviously, in terms of observation, we're going to talk about context. Note, we spoke all about the consolidation and we want to look inside that consolidation. As you go through this template, make sure you focus in on that consolidation, view what it looks like, look at all the elements within that consolidation and make sure you're really taking in the objective information inside of that consolidation. from that consolidation area, because those are the clues that we want to keep drawing out whenever we complete a template on breakouts, to ensure that if we get new clues, we're aware of them. If we get the same old clues, we want to be careful. Then in terms of obviously balanced and unbalanced, it's more important to actually identify breakout points, alright? Again, I don't want you to get too fixated on whether it's better or worse, unbalanced or unbalanced, but more so what makes a good breakout zone and what doesn't. So complete this section, really go and drill down what was the reason for potential breakout, what led you to believe it was a breakout. Write down all these things and really observe that potential breakout point because again you want to develop a methodology to determining what is a potential good breakout zone and what isn't. In terms of trade location, well obviously I did give you a couple of ideas for breakout zones like double key swing, reversals within a trend, inside days and day two. As well as obviously I mentioned, there are numerous others so just make sure you adopt these as well as any others you might have. Now in terms of them conditioning, note we obviously said for breakouts all participants are in agreement so just make sure when you are reviewing and adding to the template that all the participants are actually you know in the same direction. If, for instance, you find that as the market breaks, there's a really high degree of response straight off the break, again, make a note of that, because what you'll find is when you see that, the breakouts don't tend to be as clean.

And then obviously volatility, we do expect volatility to be subdued in consolidation But once we break, we expect a pick-up in the volatility. Let's now go and have a look at the identification of a good breakout strategy. So obviously the interaction is the real key. If we were to summarize really the entire strategy session, it's all about that moment, that calm before the storm, that real moment before the explosion and the breakouts to the upside or to the downside. Where you're gonna really get good at this strategy is focusing all your energy on the interaction side. So... Spend a lot of time thinking about where does the initiative come in, where does the response have come in, in a good breakout that gave a really big reward and a really big target, what was the early initiative like, was there any kind of response, what was the conditioning behind that interaction, that's the real nuance behind not just the strategy but all the strategies. Obviously in terms of interaction, we expect aggressive interaction, so again note is Again, in terms of timing clues, these are the clues that you definitely want to look out for that we went over. One will be absorption, delta, colouring, relative changes in volume and price, volatility shifts, velocity expansion, as well as imbalances in the market. Obviously as you complete more and more of these templates, guess what? You're going to find more clues. trying to get you guys to get into a very strong habit and a process of ultimately developing this breakout strategy for yourself. In terms of the metrics then, we want to focus on volume. It should be high on the break as all participants partake, so just watch that volume again. Low volume breaks do tend to fail. In terms of time, time is a key metric as there are positions locked in once everyone is in the same directional position. So obviously the longer we take to move in that direction, the more likely a potential for a failed break of spinal resistance is. Then in terms of delta, look for those dark shades, look for the light shades, look for the imbalances, point them out, where are they occurring, why are they occurring, what does it mean. In terms of cumulus of delta, obviously it should move in the direction of the breakout and it should accumulate in that direction as well. If it doesn't, note the divergence, okay?

And then obviously relative changes, note the relative changes you're observing, note what they could mean and what they could mean in terms of time, price, velocity, delta, volume and speed. Okay, let's have a look now then at the execution of the breakout strategy. So obviously again, money management is crucially important. We're going to be quite aggressive on this breakout, as well as passive. Aggressive for good reason, got potential for great reward. So it makes sense to potentially, if a clue is there or if a signal gets given to us, we do have a little bit of a preemptive strike, simply because the reward is there and it's justified. But also once we do get that break, we take a little bit more of an aggressive approach on that breakout. So we use both the passive and approach to execution in terms of risk. We obviously place the stop below that signal back inside the breakout zone in terms of target. Well, until the market begins the process of providing liquidity, that's the real key to breakouts. The market is going on a price discovery mode, so it will stop once it runs into liquidity being provided. Do note, obviously, breakouts do tend to extend, so don't be afraid, like we mentioned in terms of the take your profits when the market signals it and buy that first pullback as the probability for extension on breakouts is always very high. Risk-award, highest of all the strategies we're going to go through and obviously we have a very very small risk and we've got really really good methodology in this trade strategy but do recognize the fact that everyone can see a breakout trade just not everyone knows the subtle clues of when that initiative is ultimately when you should execute that breakout. In terms of application, well obviously like I said you can be exact on the breakout so you look at that exact break of a price that's just before the break but we can be a little more pre-emptive if we get one of the signals as leveraging. This is a strategy you can get highly leveraged on simply because you're a really good reward, very very tight stop and ultimately a potential fall right.

Alright guys, let's now move on to the next of our additional readings. This then brings us now to our drill section. This is the final slide of unit. So this is the second recommended book from Ryan Holiday. Obviously the first was The Obstacle is the Way. The second is Ego is the Enemy. Great book, fantastic book. provokes your thought quite a lot. Note, a summary of it, it's a research understanding of how and why of the ego. It gets you a really good understanding of why people develop an ego. What makes even people without an ego suddenly develop one? Ultimately, why is the ego such a bad thing? Now, in terms of action, very thought-provoking, and it's definitely going to give you a mindset shift. It's definitely going to make you want to adjust how you think about the ego Now in terms of the key highlights, consistent questioning, your own understanding of the self and the ego. Because this is the key takeaway, you're going to constantly be saying to yourself, well, do I have an ego? Is it creating bias in my understanding? Is it creating block, a lack of growth mindset, all these sorts of things? Always stay a student is one of the key highlights. Understand we can always grow, learn, and strive for a better version of ourselves is one of the key highlights. This is something the book does spend a lot of time going over. Obviously then ego is a natural occurrence But with practical solutions you can tame it and control it to make a better decision So again, it's not about eradicating the ego. We've all got it We have to live with it But it's about understanding it and what role it ultimately plays within us and how we can you know utilize the ego Ultimately to our advantage rather than to our disadvantage and then lastly obviously to measure the performance not on outcome, but with a scorecard. Now this is quite cool. A great little last section to the book. So yeah, I highly recommend this book. Again, it is there for you to provoke your thought ultimately and give you a better understanding of how your ego might ultimately be standing in the way. All right, let's go wrap up then.
