In the charts provided, what we have on the left side is 3 day distributions, or 3 daily profiles. Now, as you can see in the first profile, we had a relatively normal distribution. In day 2, we spent most of the day trading within the previous day's volume value area. the prices that it accepted from the previous day. Now when we see this we call this an inside day. Now the longer a market spends accepting value between two prices, the more likely as time goes by that we're likely to break out either to the upside or to the downside. The important thing to understand is not so much when we break out but what are you going to do when the market breaks out. the market can break to the upside and continue with the trend or the momentum or the market could break to the upside and then return back into value and very quickly move to the other side of the distribution. Likewise we could see the same sort of idea to the downside. What we're going to take a look at now is what the anomaly is and how we could have developed a trade strategy using this basic setup. As you can see, by the end of day 3, once the market had broken to the upside, it finished aggressively higher on the day. Now the trade setup is very simple. What we're looking for is an example of single prints anomaly. And the reason is that when the market leaves single prints as it breaks an inside day, what we tend to find is that the market continues in a trend like fashion with the trend. Once the market finally broke out of that previous day's high, we left a large amount of untraded area on the breakout. The fact that there's an untraded area once we break out, this suggests there is a high probability for extension. Now let's take a look at the second profile. The first thing to note is that what we can see is prior to the break the market had a relatively tight low volatility range. In other words, what this was suggesting was that the market wasn't yet ready to break out. Note, however, once we break out how the ranges of each individual auction become a little bit larger, suggesting more volatility in the auction. but instead be looking for continuation type plays. Now the trade is simple. What we're looking for is any sort of one confirmation that the market is going to leave an untraded area or single prints.", "transcript": "Let's now look at an example of what a basic volume profile trade setup could look like.

Once it does this and confirms this we then want to look to get with the trend. Now in the strategy you can see that we had three different time frame pricing or or auctions until we came back and retested and confirmed that that area was no longer going to be traded. Once we then took out the high of that auction that retested the break point, the market never looked back. It's very simple. The trade strategy is to get long on that retest We then look for a continuation type pattern and only get out of this trade once the market suggests we do so.
