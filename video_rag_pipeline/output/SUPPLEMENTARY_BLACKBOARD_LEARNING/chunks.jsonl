So this entire session is going to be dedicated to how does the footprint actually work? Now, before we go into this, let's just really start with this little chart on the left here, and go into the basic elements of it. times by the 719. Now these two numbers effectively all they are is they are the buying and selling interaction that has occurred at this price point over a given rotation. So every one of these as we can see in example number two, every one of these is what we call With regards to what we can see inside this box effectively on the left side we can see that a Seller has sold at this price. Let's call it price 61 a seller has sold 206 contracts now at the same price of 61 a buyer has bought 719 contracts now I know you might be a little bit confused and say well, how can they buy and sell the same price at the same time? Okay, effectively don't worry too much about that. All you need to understand is that at this price point, let's say if we were trading between price point 60 to 62, over the price point 61, there was an interaction between the buyers where the sellers sold 201, but the buyers bought 719. Now, when this will become, when this will start to make a lot more sense and become more relevant, is when we start to put it into context. And that's how you'll begin to understand and interpret the footprint a lot better, is when we begin the process of developing context. Okay, so simply the X means nothing, it's just a divide line. And ultimately, if we were to work out what is the total volume transacted at this price 61, it's simply the 206 plus the 719, which will give us 925. Okay, so 925 contracts were traded at price 61.

Now in terms of the next step or the next piece of information that we can take Okay, now the Delta is simply the net difference between the seller and buyer. Okay, so what do we mean by that? Well again, let's go back to our example. So the difference in volume traded at price 61, the difference between how a buyer and seller interacted at this price, that is ultimately the Delta. Now What you can see here, if we just simply say 719 minus the 206, that'll give us, effectively, 513. Now the next step or the next bit of statistical information we'll take from that is Ultimately what that Delta was representing was it was it the buyer that won that price? Or was it the seller that won that price in this example? Obviously we can see that there was more buying interaction at this price than selling interaction therefore we would get a positive delta from this price and ultimately it would be positive delta of 513. Now where that's important is obviously as the footprint is developing over a course of a rotation or a given period we then get something called a cumulative delta. the cumulative delta is simply all of the deltas from this rotation, this rotation, this rotation, all of them accumulated together. Okay, now just for a very basic sense, the cumulative delta is very closely watched by traders. Why? Well because we can see ultimately who is winning the fight or who's willing the battle over a given number of prices. Also The cumulative delta can sometimes very easily show you where the positioning is and ultimately are the buyers positioned long in the market or are the sellers positioned short in the market. Again, we will begin the process of utilizing all of these various statistics, both volume, delta, as well as cumulative delta, as we begin the process of developing individual Okay, so that's the basic essence of what the footprint is showing us.

So let's now move on and let's use this in a little bit of a hypothetical example. So what you've got here is three rotations. Before we go into the example, I just want to drill down some of the settings that we spoke about in the Unit 2 when you were setting it up, just so you can again, we can revisit those settings and you can understand exactly what some of those settings are. Okay, so you would be familiar with this, you've seen this quite a bit, but ultimately you've got two very basic types of settings. The first is your rotations. So, as mentioned previously, every one of those lines effectively represents a rotation. Now, you can choose to set this rotation either to bar, so a typical bar time frame, and all a bar time frame is, you can think of it as, it's nothing other than a normal traditional candlestick type time frame. Okay, so with bar type rotations, you can set the time to 5 minutes, you can set it to 30 minutes, 60 minutes, daily, monthly, whatever you would like. You can effectively create a time-based rotation with the setting bar, as we can see in the example on the left. Okay, now all a point and figure is, is it simply allows you to create a rotation based on a certain number of prices. So what do we mean? Okay, let's say prices go up by 10 prices and we've got a point and figure with a prices. Now, what this means is that the market or the footprint will keep utilizing the same rotation until such a point that the price reverses at least ten ticks in the opposite direction. Only once it prints ten prices in the opposite direction will you then begin the next rotation. Rotation number two. Okay, and obviously if prices keep going down on a straight line We won't get the next rotation until we get ten prices again in the opposite direction Okay, and that's ultimately how we get rotations based on the point and figure so those are throughout this course Those are the two source types that we are going to utilize. We are only going to utilize these two source types. Why? Well, very simply, one, we can, you know, I want to keep this simple, obviously, for you guys, but also two, I don't want to give you too many different, I don't want to give you too many options, okay?", "transcript": "delta, as well as cumulative delta, as we begin the process of developing individual Okay, so that's the basic essence of what the footprint is showing us.

Sometimes too many options is a bad thing because you're going to start to play around with it and instead of, you know, looking at your charts consistently every day, you're going to start to look for, you know, sort of trade strategies or let me rephrase, you're going to start playing with the settings, thinking that, you know, it's instead of the way you're looking at the market. So I'm going to keep it very simple, we're only going to utilize the bar. Why? Because with the bar we can play with time, and then obviously the point and figure. Why? Because the point and figure is particularly good for looking at auctions. Okay, so those are the two types of rotations you are going to deal with throughout the footprint course. The next setting I want you to focus on is ultimately the different styles of footprint you get, okay? So very simply we first spoke about the types of rotational settings you have Okay, and they were number one a bar rotation and number two a point and figure Now we're going to talk about the style and the style is just simply what do you ultimately want to see? Okay, so the traditional one, the very first one you saw on page one, which we'll come back to, is simply just the bid times the ask. Okay, and simply put, that just shows us the bid and ask at every single price, and it shows us a number at every single price. Okay, so that's the first type you can expect to see. Now the second type you can expect to see is the Delta. Now as explained the Delta is nothing more than the difference between the volume traded by buyers and sellers So again in this example, we can see the Delta between these two would be 50 now That Delta can be represented as a positive or as a negative very simply if there was more buying in at this price as we can see the Delta would obviously be positive on the day vice versa it would be negative. Okay, so when you select this option or this style of Delta, it will not show you the two separate prices, it'll merely just show you plus 50. Okay, then the third type you can expect to see, I'm just going to erase this. The third type you can expect to see is the volume. Again, very simply, instead of having the traditional, let's say, 100 by 50, you will simply just get the total, which is 150 contracts.

Now the imbalance is quite an interesting one, don't get too worried about it right now, obviously we're going to develop strategies on it as well, so I will go over this in depth later on. What it does is it utilizes a number of prices, so I'm going to give you a little basic example Okay, let's say for intensive purposes. We had 10 by 50 and we had 20 by 50 and then we had 50 by 50 Okay, now what an imbalance does is it shows you where there is a big imbalance between the buyers and the sellers now it doesn't do it at prices or at one price it does it between prices. Ok, so what it ultimately shows us is it will show us between price 60 and 61 is there an imbalance in a diagonal way. Is there an imbalance between these two prices? So all it's going to show us is as prices are moving up or prices moving down, is there a sudden shift in the way buyers are buying higher prices or sellers selling lower prices? If there is an imbalance, it will highlight it in a specific color. Again, it will look very similar to the first one I showed you, the bit-time mask, except you can ultimately set it in such a way that when there is a big imbalance or an imbalance that you think is relatively big, it will highlight it for you very nicely with some color.

Because this includes both the delta, it includes the volume, it includes the profile, and it ultimately also includes the imbalances.

Now the next thing is obviously talk about the colors. As you can see, if I go back again, I'm just going to show you what the colors mean. Okay, so if we look at these colors, again, what the colors are representing to us now is we've got different shades of color. Okay, so firstly, we obviously spoke about the delta and the volume being transacted. Now, the color represents nothing other than one, the amount of volume. Okay, so color represents the amount of volume and the type of color Okay, represents the who won that fight so that the type of color let me write the type of color is ultimately Representing the Delta okay, so again to explain this let's use a hypothetical example, and I'm going to take this price point here 697 times by 386 now The first thing is, what is the delta from this price? We can see very clearly there was more selling at this price called 61 than there was buying, so we know from that that the delta will be negative. Now, whenever there's a negative delta at a price point, it will always be red. Vice versa, if we look at the next price, obviously there was more buying in this instance. blue. Okay, so very simply, if it's red it means that there was a negative delta at that price point, if it was blue it means there was a positive delta at that price point. Now the next step is the degree of shades, okay, and you can see in this example there is three different types of shades. One is a light blue, then we've got a medium blue, then we've got a dark blue. Obviously on the other side, we've got a dark red, a medium red and a light red. Okay, so there's three different degrees or shades of red, as well as three shades of blue.", "transcript": "Why?

Now all the shades are representing is the total volume traded. So it's wonderful because it gives you a relative representation of how much volume has been traded at that price. Okay, so when there is a lot of volume being traded at a price, you'll see dark colors, either dark blue or dark red, as we can see in this example. So as you can see here, dark colors, why? Because it's the highest amount of volume relative to all the other prices in this rotation. Okay, obviously when there's little volume being traded, as we can see at the top here, in that instance we tend to see lighter colors. Ok, so that's all it is, so let's just summarise that. So firstly we have two shades. For positive we will have blue colours and for negative we will have red colours. In terms of the shades, we can choose the number of shades obviously. The default setting is 6, in other words 3 for the buying and 3 for the selling. We get a light, a medium and a dark blue and a light, a medium and a dark red. low relative amount of volume traded. Okay guys, I hope that makes a little bit more sense. I'm just gonna scroll back down. Obviously you can select more shades if you want more shades, but again keep it simple. That is the purpose of this. Let's keep it as simple as possible. Alright guys, so that's the basic settings that you're going to utilize throughout this footprint course and just most important to understand, if you do want you can obviously come and play with your colors, you can select the colors that you want on the footprint, but what I would say is don't pay too much attention to the colors, don't pay too much Keep it as it is, why? Because I'm going to show you a whole bunch of strategies and utilizing ultimately a simple footprint chart. I'm not going to complicate it because I want you guys to grasp and understand the footprint tool. Alright, last but not least, if there's any concept you're not sure about, okay, if you still don't understand, you know, what the footprint is, what each rotation is, the different settings, okay, sometimes maybe you just need to go and read over a little bit more, so you can obviously go to the help function, it's wonderful, it will explain What I would say is if you still don't understand that's okay. That's cool", "transcript": "light blue, then we've got a medium blue, then we've got a dark blue. Obviously on the other side, we've got a dark red, a medium red and a light red. Okay, so there's three different degrees or shades of red, as well as three shades of blue. Now all the shades are representing is the total volume traded. So it's wonderful because it gives you a relative representation of how much volume has been traded at that price. Okay, so when there is a lot of volume being traded at a price, you'll see dark colors, either dark blue or dark red, as we can see in this example. So as you can see here, dark colors, why? Because it's the highest amount of volume relative to all the other prices in this rotation. Okay, obviously when there's little volume being traded, as we can see at the top here, in that instance we tend to see lighter colors. Ok, so that's all it is, so let's just summarise that.
