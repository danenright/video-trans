Now, as you can see in the example provided, I've actually given you four separate profiling days and you can see each one has got an element of overlap. Now the reason I want to show you this is because this sort of overlap can continue to occur for a number of days. This overlap, whilst we can still develop various strategies, is showing a slightly less conviction or slightly less likelihood of aggressive trend in one direction or the other. As you can see and remember, it's important to note what percentage of overlap are In these examples, what we can see is that we can see almost roughly 50% of overlap is occurring in each one of these four days. Now some days this may occur, say, or this overlap may only be 10 to 20%, some days it may be 80 or 90%. Keeping track of this basic relative percentage can help you, it can aid your trading and give you vital information about what the market is trying to do.", "transcript": "Now, the second example with slightly more conviction than the fully contained value area is where we have a slight overlap of today's value area relative to the previous day's value area.
