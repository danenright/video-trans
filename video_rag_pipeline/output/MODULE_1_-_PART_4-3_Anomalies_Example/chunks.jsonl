Take a second to have a look at the chart on the left. Try and identify what the anomaly is. As you can see, on the left side we've got a daily volume profile in the German Tenier Bund. Now noted before we said some of the key anomalies you can find are tails, low As you can see in this example, we've got two areas or two single print areas within this distribution. This area is the area where we have single TPOs or single time price opportunities. This can be illustrated by the lower print at the bottom of the distribution, as well as the higher print or the print within the higher end of the distribution. Now, we know this anomaly is not supposed to be there. We know it's unusual based on pattern recognition. Therefore, the fact that it's unusual means that at some point in time it should be filled out and the market should return to these prices and turn those low volume areas into high volume areas. As you can see, the market took that low volume error and filled it out. It completed the puzzle. That's a good example of what a volume or what an anomaly looks like, but more importantly how the market comes back to complete those anomalies. As said before, we will discuss some very key trading opportunities around these anomalies", "transcript": "Let's now take a look at a basic example of an anomaly that you can find in the markets.
