Again, that was the key takeaway in terms of volume as a key identifier. Just make sure when talking about volume, you're interpreting, is it relatively high volume showing potential new business and potential for momentum, or is it low volume which is far more noise and far more likely to see mean reverting type strategies. very little to us.

So Some of the identifiers we spoke about with regards to volume were the volume value area, what size was the volume value area, what range of prices, where was it located, etc. We then also spoke about the volume at the various prices, and we said how if we had low volume at the extremes, whether that's the low or the high, this would indicate If we had high volume at the extremes, that would be an anomaly, whereas if we had relatively low volume, that would be suggestive of quite a strong auction process off the extremes. We then also spoke about the sudden shift and the sudden relative change in volume over the period of the day and how this could be an indicator of potential momentum coming into the market. We then moved on and spoke about the value area and the ways in which the previous day's value area corresponds to the current day's value area. We had four basic examples. The first one we spoke about was where the previous day's value area is well contained within the current day's value area. We then said our second example was where we had a degree of overlap between the value areas. For instance, day two's value area would have some sort of overlap with day one. Again we said this is a relatively balanced day type, and again showing us a lack of We then moved on to play three where we said we had no overlap in terms of value error and we spoke about how this sort of a play again showed us a little bit more directional conviction as well as a little bit more impetus to move the market one way or the other. We then moved on to the fourth type which was where we had a complete engulfing value area where the day two session completely engulfed the day one value area and we spoke about this showing us a sudden shift in volatility in the market and obviously creating various types of opportunity. So those are the four examples of types of value area overlap that you can expect We then moved on and spoke very briefly about high-volume areas and low-volume areas and how prices tend to attract and return to high-volume areas, whereas low-volume areas almost show us a little bit of initiative in the market and there's a tendency for the market to want to move away from those areas until such a point that it begins", "transcript": "the previous couple of minutes volume or the previous couple of days or hours.
