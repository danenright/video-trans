It helps determine the nature of congestion or trend characteristics of the market. When the market is in a range, whatever time frame you're looking at, generally within by low order activity, by lack of market liquidity, by very slow auctioning activity and really low volume that's going through in that specific market that you're looking at. It helps identify the potential market participants and strategies being executed. As we've mentioned, the higher the market velocity, the more you're going to see the ocean of execution strategies that are being engaged in when we start looking trading strategies and order flow patterns that we observe later on in the course. It helps determine the conviction or lack thereof in a move and this helps the strategy selection. You know if a market is breaching some technical charting boundary but it's not being met by strong auctioning activity and the velocity is not remaining constant or actually increasing, well then you're going to start lightening your size load, you're going to start lightening Whereas if the auction activity continues to progress, continues to become heightened, you're actually not only going to hold your trade, you might even add more significant size. As I mentioned in the prior modules, the best traders are the traders who know when to deploy the most size when the market is showing you the greatest amount of activity and conviction in your trade. Whereas when the market is not showing you that, it's your ability to reduce your size in a very accelerated manner. It also helps the ability to determine if the market is ideal for certain types of price absorption patterns which are really easy to see when the when the orders are going through very aggressively in the marketplace flipping when the auctioning activity is very low you can observe certain type of flipping price action when orders are being pulled because there's one main participant that's effectively bossing the market in an area where he's not going to be exposed to other larger time frame participants who might overwhelm him with their orders. As well as momentum plays, you know when you have your for the greatest momentum plays when the market starts Moving beyond its congested boundary you want good activity going through on the ladder. You want a lot of orders to be going through. You want a lot of exchange happening between the buyers and sellers where everyone is putting their hands up wanting iPads at that price and the market will keep on tracking higher until there are less hands being exposed in the air and not many people want to be engaging buying iPads at", "transcript": "Let's discuss the importance of market velocity.
