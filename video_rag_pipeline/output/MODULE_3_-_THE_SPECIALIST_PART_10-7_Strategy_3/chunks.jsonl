So let's go through the strategy. I'm going to show you the basic characteristics, the rules, preconditions, how you execute, and some of the things you can expect to see when developing this trade. Now the imperative thing to understand is what do we mean by open. What I want to illustrate is there's no exact correct time frame for open, but what I've found traditionally is it tends to be at the beginning of where there's a surge of volume and volatility. Now, the open drive varies across different markers, and I'm going to show you some examples. So we will see an example in a bit and I will show you what a traditional Bund open drive looks like. In terms of the e-mini S&Ps, this would traditionally come at 2.30 once the cash put session begins. We would then have a look at the oil and again there's no exact time for this but this can come from potentially in the European session from around 8am or even in And lastly, the Eurodollar FX, again, there's no exact time, but traditionally I've found this begins somewhere around 8 a.m. when the European markets come. Now, the important thing to understand is not necessarily the exact time. No trade strategy is ever exact. What is exact is the characteristics and the principles I'm going to show you about the trade strategy. So when you see those characteristics, you can execute them, and over time, you will start to notice when this open drive occurs and at which time in the various markets. Now, let's get straight into it and talk about the characteristics. So, as you can see in the example of the e-mini S&P, this started at around 2.30pm in the afternoon. What I want to illustrate is the initiative. The initiative is the most important aspect of this trade strategy, and you can see that very early on, the market has shown this initiative, and we've opened up with a K-print and an L-print and an M-print and an N-print, and we've moved from 21.14 all the way to 21.36 very early on. Now, that is the single early or biggest clue of the open drive, which is we see the initiative", "transcript": "Welcome to strategy three the first in a series of the momentum trade strategies quite possibly my favorite Strategy that I you know that I've developed and it's called the open drive So I've named it the open drive because one it comes traditionally at the open of a market and You know to it drives and it shows real initiative and intent and you know If you're well prepared early on in the session and you're awake and switched on, you know start your day off to a real good start, and that's why I love the open drive.

Now, that is the single early or biggest clue of the open drive, which is we see the initiative very early on, that initiative tends to be very volatile, we tend to see a lot of volume, So that's the important thing to understand. We do a relatively large range with a lot of volume in a very short space of time early on in the session. Those are the basic key fundamentals and characteristics of the open drive. The reasoning behind why this occurs and why it tends to occur at the beginning of a session is because there is new business that needs to be done and that's imperative to understanding this strategy. someone or a big institution has received an order and they need to execute that order at best price possible. Now, there may be a number of institutions doing the same trade, but the logic is that the market will keep moving until that large order can find some responsive sellers in this example and hopefully get that, or utilize that liquidity to fill out the order. The problem that tends to occur, however, is when there isn't sufficient liquidity in the market, we then tend to see the continuation of the open drive play over the course of the day. So that's the key. When you see an open drive, it's important to understand that this can potentially be the beginning of a trend day, but also more importantly, the initiative tends to hold throughout the current session. Now, imperative to point out, when we talk about preconditions and rules, the opening price is an absolute line in the sand. We should at no point, one, be getting close to that opening price, or two, taking it out. If we do, however, that is showing us that the initiative is not only lost, but also any kind of long positioning from the open could be washed out, and we ... sometimes do see some very aggressive reversals in the opposite direction. So keep that in the back of your mind whilst developing this trade strategy. Now in terms of execution, so where does the actual strategy come into play and how can we take advantage of it? So the simple answer is that If you do miss this first initiative, it's not easy to get onto that initial initiative because more often than not you're probably buying it quite high up, there's probably a little bit of disbelief in what you're seeing, you may even be on the opposite side", "transcript": "very early on, the market has shown this initiative, and we've opened up with a K-print and an L-print and an M-print and an N-print, and we've moved from 21.14 all the way to 21.36 very early on.

That is okay because that is not where the highest probability opportunity is. on the first pull-back. That is the key to developing this strategy and that is the key to making money out of the open drive. So what I would typically look for is I would measure the length of that initial move and I would be looking somewhere around the 38.2 percent I would be looking for an initiative buyer to re-enter the market. So note what I've said, I don't passively enter the market at 38.2, I allow the market to pull back and the minute I see any sort of a reloading or a buyer becoming a little more intentional on that pullback, I then execute very aggressively at market looking extension. In terms of risk, well once you see that buyer entering, again you want to measure what is the potential opportunity that you are going to receive, but to make sure I execute this trade well and stay in it with the correct stop, I always position my stop around the 50% of the day. The reason behind this is that I know if I'm getting in roughly somewhere around the 38.2%, that's giving me roughly a 12% stop versus the potential for 38% of the move reward. By that very definition, I am taking on a very good risk-reward strategy and more importantly, I'm utilizing the objective information the market's giving me and sticking So that is the basic premise of how the open drive works. Now what I'd like to do is I just want to show you another example of an open drive that we typically see in the German Bund. it starts or comes from seven to eight a.m. So as you can see by the chart, again, notice a very wide initial balance, notice the lack of overlap in a really large K-tail, and then once the cash comes in with this imprint, notice how quickly we extend upon the initial range of the day. The market then moves sideways, has a little pullback before we then extend, pullback, extend, pullback, and extend. Now, this example is slightly different to the previous, as the pullback isn't as deep.", "transcript": "So the simple answer is that If you do miss this first initiative, it's not easy to get onto that initial initiative because more often than not you're probably buying it quite high up, there's probably a little bit of disbelief in what you're seeing, you may even be on the opposite side thinking this is a good area to potentially sell, so a lot of the time we do miss this early initiative.
