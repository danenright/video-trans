Again, just a few things to point out before we actually go through the strategy. Don't forget, the first and foremost, we have to develop. context. Now what I want to talk about in terms of the context very simply is that bear in mind we do have the three types of double distribution strategies you can find. So the first and foremost was when we spoke about a double distribution that occurs over Now, this is the example we're going to talk about in this Euro-dollar example, but this is the first example we spoke about as we went through the double distribution strategy. The second of the two that you can expect to find is where we have a double distribution that actually continues with the initiative move. So we tend to see the double distribution not being filled out, but actually a continuation The third type that we spoke about was where we have a double distribution on low volume that actually gets filled out on the same day and ends up looking a little bit like a big distribution. This is the three types of distribution you can expect to see within the double The first thing to understand is that we need to just talk a little bit about the context of what was happening in the Eurodollar FX before we started with this distribution. So if we look just towards the left side, what we had was on day one we had effectively a big double distribution where the market had formed two separate little areas of acceptance. tried and tested lower so it attempted the move lower, attempted to sort of find any kind of price discovery below day one's price accepted area and it failed and then decided to move higher and actually accept value within that lower value area but also then just a little bit of a value area except a little bit higher. Now the important thing to point out was that on day three we actually started to completely fill out between the two distributions and complete the strategy. The two key points to reference when talking about the double distribution strategy is first and foremost we're looking to fill out the low value area. that day two's high, that becomes our first key reference point, and secondly, almost that VPOC, or somewhere around the most accepted area within that second distribution, those become our effective two most important areas, so somewhere around there and somewhere around", "transcript": "Welcome to the replay series again, this time for strategy 2, which will be the double distribution strategy.

Those are the areas I want you to watch as we go through this replay function. So let's get into it then, let's hit the play button and we can start to go Now, as you can see, the market opens up. We're firmly inside the previous day's value area, so a very slow sort of docile type start to the day. Now again, the important thing to understand as the day develops is the characteristics, so all sorts of how is the market moving, what's making the market move, where is the market showing a little bit of volume and volatility, what are the key points within the market that's creating this volume and volatility, who is creating the volume and volatility, is it buyers creating the move to the downside or is it sellers creating the move to the downside? These are all sorts of the characteristics you want to be looking out for when viewing the profile replay. The first thing to point out is note how for the first four half-hour sessions the market is firmly contained within the previous day's range. What I want to point out, this is very, very key because when a market tends to have this much overlap as we've seen in this area of the previous day's value, there tends to be a high tendency of two-way trade. The B-print comes down and quite aggressively, notice the B-print, there's our first little signal. So notice how the B-print not only does it engulf the A-print, but it then very quickly reverses and almost takes out the entire range. Next we can see the C-print, note the aggression now on the C-print. So we can see quite a big surge in the volume and volatility. No surprise this is the beginning or this is the opening of the European markets. Now, as you can see, the market's range is expanding, the volatility is expanding, and we're starting to see the market just distribute between a 105.060 and 105.30, within a 30 pip range. So again, all we're seeing is the market filling out this area within the previous day's accepted area.

So the first thing to point out is note the extreme volume surge and volatility surge as we take out the previous day's high. So that would be our first referencing point is that previous day's high. As we said, when there's a low volume area there's a lot of stops that tend to be placed just ahead of that low volume area. So note, once that low volume area went, notice how quickly that E-print went all the way from 105.60 all the way up to 105.80. So a good 20-pip move before the F-print then continued. So that would be our first, in terms of execution, that would be the first sort of trade we'd be looking to execute on this double distribution play, which is a series of stopouts of anyone who's short ahead of that low volume area. Then note, our second strategy, our second play we'd be looking for is a retest of Now, note how quickly, once we targeted up there, the market double-topped and then very quickly reversed and came in and tested again that area where the stops were triggered. So both our first trade opportunity, which is a play for the stops. and our second play, which is a retest of the high volume air, both trade setups showed us very good price response. It showed us a very good, on the break to the upside, we saw some nice initiation from the buyers, and then from the downside, we saw some very aggressive response come in from the sellers. And that's what's key, guys. That's what's paramount when you're viewing these things. It's all good and well having a strategy and an idea how a market should play out but do the buyers and sellers actually play it out in that way and that's why this replay functionality is so excellent to add to your trading because you can visually see how the buyers and the sellers interact with one another. Now, let's talk a little bit about some of the management aspects of this trade. Well, firstly, note, if we're getting involved for that stop break on this E print, somewhere around that 105-60 area, you should expect to see momentum. Why? Because it's a stop play. So anyone who's short, in and ahead of that low volume area, should be stopping out once we take out that 105-60 area. So again, it's a momentum play. type plays.

If we're going to be passively entering, well then we need to maybe manage a clip a little bit differently. We need to maybe split the clip in two and as the market shows us that it's turning, maybe then add on.

We then need to see buyers and sellers interacting and distributing within that Don't forget, the markets very often, when there is a low volume area within the market, they do tend to want to turn that low volume area into a high volume area. So that's our second strategy, the double distribution. Make sure when you go over the strategy, make sure you don't just take the example I've shown you. Make sure you go out and you find the three examples that we've discussed within More importantly, go get a host of a number of different examples over as many markets as you can find because if you get a number of examples, you're going to learn to develop various ways in which you can execute the same strategy.
