Artificial intelligence effectively to that machine but you don't recognize it is a machine because isn't that not artificial intelligence when it almost represents itself as a being that has this that has his conscious intelligence and so therefore the power of man over machine is until a machine can process information contextually in a non-linear fashion and this is what human you know we can draw from you know millennia of of where we've developed at this stage as you know or how we evolved at this stage with this incredibly complex you know as I refer to this operating system that draws from so many multiple that uses all these nerve endings is able to act with instinct and gut intelligence and we can put things into contextual framework and because of that we are so much more effective than the machine. The machine can process at greater speeds and so forth but if you put the entire picture you know in front we can consider so many variables through our collective experience as opposed to a machine that always constantly needs updating new inputs and readjustment and we can readjust more effectively in this landscape.

And it's really this constant deliberate practice. You need to go, as I've mentioned before, go through this entire module again and employ a ritual, really important. And build a conceptual framework of pattern recognition. We've given you some key matrixes in this course and some key worksheets on to build your foundation, developing your skillset as a price-laden trader. I've told you those two worksheets that you need to print out, put them on your desk so you can really tick them off of these certain patterns that you observe in the marketplace. And when you observe these patterns, you're building your foundational elements in really understanding, retrieving price ladder patterns and price ladder pattern recalls more effectively and more powerfully so you can profit from those plays. And in return with that, you start developing price memory. So. all the best in the development of yourself in this incredible space of training in the financial markets.
