I hope you managed to complete the playbook from part 1 easily. In part 2 we're going to discuss 3 main principles. The first will be key market participants. The second will be key timeframe participants. And the third will be the basic auction process. So let's get to it. Key market participants. It is obvious that there is a buyer for every seller and a seller for every buyer. Whilst it is obvious, what many fail to understand is what time frame buyer or seller is making the sale or purchase. This powerful piece of knowledge unlocks key information about potential for future direction. What do we mean by this? Well simply put, if we were to observe prices going higher in the market, the basic assumption would be that there are buyers or more buyers than sellers in the market. shorts that are covering their shorts and buying out of those shorts which is taking the market higher. Understanding what moves prices or what time frame is moving prices or which participants is key to unlocking future direction. By observing the auction process unfolding via volume profiling, we can begin to assess It's imperative, guys, as we go through the rest of this module and the strategies in Module 2 and 3, that you understand how these different participants are interacting. Because it's this interaction that is going to lead to success or failure of the various trade setups. Let's talk about the three major participants. Commercial, Speculative and Automated. The first and most influential, Commercial. large institutions like banks and hedges or hedging strategies. Now, in order to understand how commercial participants move the market we need to first look at the characteristics that define commercial participants. The first characteristic not price sensitive. What does this mean? If we would take a basic example of a hedge fund. Let's say they get into a long position and the price starts to go against them. They're not too concerned about which price they get out at. Why? Because their objective is to just lock in profits. So once they get out, they are executing at the best price possible regardless of where it is. Equally, if we take the example of a pension fund, every month they need to rebalance their portfolios. If at the end of the month they find themselves short of bonds, they have to buy those So, they are not going to be calling up the banks and worrying too much about price, they're merely going to execute at the best price possible.", "transcript": "Welcome to part 2.

This lack of being price sensitive can sometimes drive markets beyond certain points that we are used to, and it's important to understand why they're being driven in such a way. Our next characteristic, natural hedging. A lot of the large institutions tend to execute via hedging strategy. This can sometimes create confusion, as we would expect all bond markets to be highly correlated, yet sometimes they move in opposite directions. It's important to understand these hedges, as this can cause us a lot of frustration in various setups. The next characteristic, capital preservation. Again, a crucial understanding for commercial paper is that they are expected to preserve capital at all costs. and that is why sometimes we can see some very aggressive moves in one direction and the other as these large institutions enter into the market with paper in order to preserve capital trade value. Large commercial institutions don't always participate in the market. They rarely participate within the middle of ranges.
