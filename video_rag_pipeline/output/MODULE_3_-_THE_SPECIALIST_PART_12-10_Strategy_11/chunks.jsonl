Now, as you can see in the example provided, a tail is nothing more than a TPO or a single TPO that comes off either the high or the low.

The smaller the tail does not imply there's less opportunity, but the probability of a large winner is less likely. So that's the key characteristic to understand with regards to the tail.

So the first type of tail you're going to see is the symmetrical tail. This tail looks a little bit like this. Now what creates the symmetry is we tend to see an aggressive move up towards an extreme. This initiative and response of selling together takes the market quite aggressively in the opposite direction. The second type of tail you can expect to see is a non-symmetrical tail. As the name suggests, this is a tail that we come up in a relatively straight manner. The market then doesn't reverse in an equal and opposite type manner, but rather sort of grinds in the opposite direction. Now, the reason we differentiate between these two types of tails is because each tail will have a slightly different execution methodology. The first type, the symmetrical, we would need to be relatively more aggressive in terms of our execution and entry. So once we see the market respond aggressively off an extreme, we need to be looking to Whereas in a non-symmetrical, we can afford to be a little more passive on our entry and rather sell into any kind of a counter move. Now before we actually take a look at some of the examples of the tails you can expect Now, the single most important rule in order to achieve the success of the strategy, as well as the control identifier, is we need the candle to confirm the tail. In other words, a tail is only confirmed once it's actually closed. So what do we mean by that? If we see, as in the example, we see the Y-print come up the page, moves aggressively This is very suggestive of a reversal type candle, but only once that close has occurred can we then look to execute either in a symmetrical tail manner or in a non-symmetrical tail manner. Now, once the candle's closed, as you can see in this example, we see the Y-print come up the page, it then closes and we can then execute our short side trades. With this in mind, let's take a look at the execution methodology.

In the other example where we have non-symmetrical, we need to keep the stop in its original position until such a point that the market shows us a confirmed turning point. Let's now move on and have a look at the different types of tails in an example. As you can see in the examples provided, the first example we have two nicely graphically depicted tails. and the Q's at the lows. Now again, remember, we said the size of the tail is relatively important, but also the type of the tail. In this example, we can see we have got a non-symmetrical type tail, meaning that once the marker does turn, whilst it does effectively reverse, we do see a much slower, Again, we enter only once we are confirmed a tail, we place our stop above the high or the low, and we look to trade this trade back in towards the distribution. In the second example, you can see not just what an aggressive symmetrical tail looks So as you can see, this tail is hidden because, well traditionally, a non-hidden tail is one where we can see the single prints. In this example, we can see the Z prints move higher, but then the very next candle, the A prints aggressively reverse. Now whilst this isn't visually a tail, it is a hidden tail as we still have the Key to understanding when we do have this symmetrical reversal tail is the aggressive nature at which we have to enter, which we can see in the third example. Notice how the Z print moves quite aggressively higher, it closes, and the A print reverses in the opposite direction.
