So anything that's almost counter-intuitive to the principle, that effectively is a weak control variable and those weak control variables tend to be overcome. So again, an anomaly is a single price or price level that lacks symmetry. this and the anomalies are created through a combination of time, volume and price. Now when we see these anomalies it's not so much a case that they get corrected straight at some point in future they will get corrected. And that's why we want to identify between strong or strength in the control variable as opposed to weakness in the control variable. When there's strength, we do not go against it. We develop strategies that continue with the strength, with the time frame or the participant that's in control. Equally, when we have weak control variables, we want to look to go counter and fill out correct the anomaly. Now one of the anomalies would be when value is established at one end of the profile but the market closes well away from the value at the end of the day. So just imagine for the entire session the market accepts that value has been accepted between price 10 and 15 but the market somehow manages to close up at around 20s. This Then when we have bad highs and bad lows, we spoke about this in previous sections. Again, seeing double TPO's at the high or the low or seeing very high volume or relatively high volume transact at the highest prices and the lowest prices of the day is very unusual and that anomaly tends to get corrected. when we have the volume point of control and the value area at opposite sides of the profile. Again, if the market accepts value at the lower bound, but somehow manages to shift the highest traded volume at the highest price of the day, that's a very unusual pattern. We have seen this data, we've spoken about it, it is the double distribution day and a lot of the time when we see this, we do tend to see the low volume area filled out in the next couple of sessions. And then a low volume area within a value area. So it's very unusual that a market very aggressively goes and leaves a very aggressive area away from a value area. It does tend to fill out the value area. So if at the end of the day you see a value area that's got a lot of low volume traded areas, that point will eventually be traded out.", "transcript": "So in essence, with the little fishies there, the control variable that shows weakness is anything that I like to think of as an anomaly.
