In the following slide, we are going to focus on some of the key rules to understand about the financial markets, including the key participants, the objective of these participants, the skills required to be successful as a trader, and some of the skills and processes that First most important thing to understand is who are you playing against? Who are the players in this game or you know in this game of trading? Now there's a number of different players and I've kind of summarized them into five so the first and you know and the biggest players being your pension funds, your hedge funds, your institutions, your banks, these are what we call influential players in other words they can move price around based on the decisions that they make. Okay, now no one, none of us, not myself included, none of us are influential in the market that we can actually manipulate, or not manipulate, but maneuver prices and actually make price go up and down. So straight away, you've got to say to yourself, well, I'm not an influential player. The next type of player is a speculative player. Now, again, a speculative player in this definition, we try and include or more lean towards, again, influential type players. In other words, we're looking at hedge funds that are taking a directional view on whatever market it may be, and they either get stopped out or they don't. They're not holding that product or that asset class until maturity or something like that. So, the next type of player is a speculative player. does not include us as a retail market, as day traders, as short-term traders. We then have the high-frequency traders. Now, again, this might include some of you, some of you that have developed algorithms, this includes you. The important thing to understand with regards to the players that play in the high-frequency is they develop strategies that, one, are very exact and, two, have very specific both risk and reward.

If you are a day trader or swing trader, I'm going to outline for you now, firstly, what is your objective? Secondly, what are the skills you need? And then third, what is the process? And that's where the meat of tonight's whole periscope is gonna be. So your objective as a day trader slash swing trader, first and foremost, is to develop consistency. Now, what you need to say to yourself when you go through your strategies, when you do your debriefs in a day, when you're thinking of great new ideas, you need to ask yourself, well firstly, I am a day trader or a swing trader. Secondly, what I'm doing right now, this hour I'm spending doing whatever I may be doing, is that ultimately going to get me toward that objective of consistency? Now, the perfect example I like to use is sometimes someone will send me a long timeframe day chart and they'll say, well, what do you think about holding this for the next three weeks for a 10% gain? And I'll say, okay, well, hang on a sec, are you a influential player? Are you a speculative player? Are you able to sit with a massive capital position for a number of days? And the simple answer for 99% of us is no. Okay, so in order to develop consistency you're going to be needing to trade more frequently, okay, and in order to trade more frequently you cannot be taking, you know, one or two or three or monthly type trades.

Influential players don't tend to use as much leverage as what we do as day traders and swing traders. Again, high frequency traders have a very different objective when it comes to leverage that we do as day traders and swing traders. Okay, so it's so important to understand, number one, what player are you? Based on that player, what is your objective? All right, once you know what your objective is, then it's very simple to determine what are the skills that you are going to need to learn to develop in order to get towards your objective. So the first is consistency, okay? Now, this consistency skill, you're not going to develop by chopping and changing your strategies, by looking at various different markets, by trading futures one day, then trading equities, by following some guy on Twitter and taking whatever trades he spends out. You're not going to develop consistency if you're going and taking this approach. Okay, the next, spec, sorry guys, I actually don't think I've filled in the skills here. Okay, I'm going to give you the skills because I've written them down. So the first is consistency, the second is discipline. Now again, with regards to discipline, how are you going to develop discipline? Well, the only way to develop discipline is to be in a number of different situations over different periods of time, different times of day, different days of the week. That's the only way you're going to learn to develop discipline. Now again, if you're sitting in trades and only doing one trade a day, are you as a day trader, as a last week trader? Probably not, all right? The next skill you need to develop is patience, okay? Again, how are you gonna develop patience? Well, you're not gonna develop patience by putting a trade in the market and then putting in a stop and putting in a target and never watching it, all right? Because ultimately by watching it, you're gonna learn and take away a lot of information from the market. And then finally, the last skill that you're going to need to develop is a little bit of what I like to call good old fashioned pain threshold or real determination and grit. And again, the only way you're going to learn to develop this, the only way you're going to get through the hard knocks is by ultimately doing a lot of trading, going through those trades, really just trying to develop yourself through the hard knocks. Okay, so once we have developed firstly the players, we understand the players of the market, then we determine what our objective is as based on the player we are as well as the skills we need in order to achieve that objective, we then go to the process. Okay, now the process is very simple and I want you to write this down and think about it over the period of the week.", "transcript": "every single day okay now that objective differs you know if you're again if you're a swing trader it might be okay to have a few drawdowns for monday tuesday wednesday so long as thursday friday when you do go inside or make money it makes back all of those losses Okay, and then the last objective is leverage, right?

Straight away, you should be able to outline, well, you know, I'm really, really good trading volatile markets. I really like it when the markets are fast, there's breakouts, there's a lot of clean breaks, the market's moving aggressively, I really like that. And you write it down as a strength. You then do the same and you write down what are your weaknesses as a trader. If you're very bad at risk management, or you're really bad at being disciplined to stick through the trade until it's achieved what it should, then you write Again, the reason is you will start to develop strategy based on your strengths and not your weaknesses. There is zero point in trying to be a breakout trader if you suck at breakouts. There's just no point. Now when I get to the pattern recognition part, I'm going to show you how this all Then, where do you fit in? In other words, where do you fit in into this whole entire market? Are you a trader that scalps? Are you a trader that likes to sit for a couple of hours on a trade? What kind of trades do you like to do? Where do you feel most comfortable? Do you prefer the market coming to you and you're getting passively in the market or do you prefer to be aggressive and provide liquidity to the market? Hopefully that mentored session really drove home the understanding behind the different participants and why it's so important to know who you're actually interacting with in the market and who's ultimately creating which strategy. It is obviously quite an important part of our template as it is a very very important principle to identifying when a trade strategy will have a higher probability of success or lower probability of success. Now in the next strategy, this is obviously a counter training strategy again in terms of it's no longer standalone, this is the third of our context and footprint strategies and obviously it requires a very aggressive execution methodology. So this is a little bit of a patient man's strategy, this does require a lot of patience. It's one of those strategies that you won't necessarily always see a lot of the time you'll see it maybe at the end of the day you'll be like oh there was that strategy again.

Okay, now guess what trial and error is synonymous for failure and all things being equal Failure should imply a loss in trading. So if you're insufficiently capitalized one you're not going to follow the rule and the process of trial and error which means ultimately you're going to fail okay so that's one of the rules being well capitalized now traders for some odd reason and again i think it's because of the the uh the real speculative lucrative nature of trading there's still rarely this belief in the financial markets that you can get I firmly believe the game was very different 20 years ago But then the game was very different 20 years ago in say for instance the property market, okay", "transcript": "In terms of that obviously some of the principles we're going to focus on you can see within the slide but some of the key real focus points here are going to be the understanding of the delta and the cumulative delta as well as the shading around that delta and We're obviously going to move a little bit deeper into, you know, positioning and pocket positioning of the delta as well as liquidity and we're then definitely going to pay attention to the end where we introduce our color lines so that we make sure that when we have what we call a line in the sand, we can very easily identify it with a nice red color line.

Okay, you're ultimately headed for some sort of a run out of the markets now note once you do have the structure which is what the rules ultimately create only then do you begin the process of bending them why because through bending them you're going to create edges okay dynamic edges edges that no one else has created because guess what not many people are willing to bend those rules okay now the next thing to pay attention This concept of a footprint Delta position unwinds is very simple. Okay, I'm gonna illustrate it for you and you'll go straight away You'll be like I've seen that before so All it is is a market moves up or a market moves down the up move creates their bias or the down move Creates a bias now that bias Okay, the bias can come from two Factors one can be technical and one can be fundamental and I'm going to go through some of the biases that can be created with both of these. Now when there's biases in the market the most important thing to note is a bias equals a cumulative delta. This is the one trade strategy or one of the few trade strategies where the cumulative delta is very very important. Okay, so in essence we lean on the cumulative Delta to recognize the fact that there is a natural bias in the market as a result of either technical implications or fundamental implications now What happens is the market begins the process of turning back around? Okay, we're not we're not too concerned about how it turns around why it turns around etc. Etc We just acknowledge the fact that the market turns around it then reaches a point Okay, which we are going to give a red line to a red line as we mentioned in the color line section of unit three That is a key observation or a key price.

Now when there's biases in the market the most important thing to note is a bias equals a cumulative delta. This is the one trade strategy or one of the few trade strategies where the cumulative delta is very very important. Okay, so in essence we lean on the cumulative Delta to recognize the fact that there is a natural bias in the market as a result of either technical implications or fundamental implications now What happens is the market begins the process of turning back around? Okay, we're not we're not too concerned about how it turns around why it turns around etc. Etc We just acknowledge the fact that the market turns around it then reaches a point Okay, which we are going to give a red line to a red line as we mentioned in the color line section of unit three That is a key observation or a key price. Okay, we're gonna call this line in the sand In other words, this is a price In which the market should not really be getting beyond with", "ocr_text": null, "visual_caption": null, "metadata": {"chunk_idx": 5}}

Now again like I said to the previous unit this is not an exhaustive list okay and you should not see this as the only ways of identifying a line in the sand okay. How you're going to learn this trade strategy is you've got to start off with step one okay so let's go through this again step aggressive cumulative delta okay that's how we agree that's how we identify it note we also want to identify it with some form of strength showing us that bias okay so that can be imbalances it could be maybe single prints it could be low volume areas okay it could be shallow distribution so some form of trend we want to see in the market that signals and identifies that bias once the market returns to that red line that we've created which we've obviously now identified a number of ways we can identify it.

What will tend to happen around this line in the sand and this is a wonderfully intricate strategy and the tip I'm going to give you for this trade strategy is always know the market positioning. it shows the market's short-term bias. In other words, if you know what this cumulative delta is at any point, whether it's over the day, the week, the couple of weeks, you've got a very powerful piece of information because you have a good understanding of who's more aggressive between buyers and sellers versus which way is price ultimately going. Ultimately, when we return back to that price point, what you're going to see is our last stand of defense. Now, the reason this trade works well and why we get a good opportunity to enter is that the market will come back to this red line in the sand and it will pause. You always tend to get a little bit of a mess about around this line in the sand. It always messes around the other first time.

That's the point in which we want to execute. So we want to see some form of sideways distribution just before the break. Once we have the break, when we see a little bit of absorption just before the break from the sellers in this example, we then execute with a relatively tight stop looking for the unwind of the delta. Now stop is very, very simple above the top of the distribution. as a root of thumb potentially extend the low of the day. Once it does that it enters a period of exhaustion and will likely take a break. So we either look for an unwind of the delta or an extension of the low.

I'd say a large delta for the pound. You're looking somewhere around one and a half to two thousand contracts But it is a relatively good example of a delta unwind So I'm just gonna go through it with you, but bear in mind you do get better examples with much higher cumulative deltas. Now also note You don't necessarily have to go from a high delta So you could have maybe positive 400 delta and when it unwinds it goes to maybe minus 3,000 delta. Okay So ultimately what you do want to see remember the Delta can be slightly misleading in other words as we're coming up here We could be seeing more selling than buying even though prices are rising hence. Why we're not seeing the Delta pick up aggressively, okay, so Again, like I said the community Delta is important But it's not necessary to be all and end on again You know if you observe this pattern within your templates time and time again, you're gonna see what works better than not now", "transcript": "You always tend to get a little bit of a mess about around this line in the sand.

You see a little bit of response now We've got our line in the sand. Okay. This is a line in the sand. This was over a data piece okay this is where the data started so we're looking at drawing a red line this is our line in the sand as this is where the data point began ultimately sorry this is not where the delta positioning began it began on this line okay that's where the data came out we can see the market moved higher a little bit of absorption moved higher again quite a lot of absorption. So we're not interested in this first part, that's all data related, we're not really interested. What we are interested in is if the marker does move back to this red line which we've created, we are interested in a potential unwind of the delta. Now we can see that delta gets all the way up to 615, marker comes back, we see a little bit of accumulation, then we start to see a little bit of imbalance on the south side. Marker comes back to test it very briefly sits below the line okay so like i said to you previously what you will tend to see is you will tend to see the market sit on both sides of the line and trade it out it tried to do this okay so we can see very briefly it did try and and fill this out but ultimately it happened so quickly i think we only traded as we can see they only traded 920 contracts in Okay, so ideally this is where we would have executed in and around that area Obviously, we'll be selling on the break of that low Looking for an extension stop above the absorption zone profit once the market ultimately takes out the Delta or Extends upon the low. Okay. That's our first example. So our second example. We look at is the WTI oil 20th of December 2017 Well, we can see obviously a really really high volume surge here Market has an aggressive down move quite an aggressive delta real technical bias in the market and a real key line in the sand posted Now note the market obviously begins the process of auctioning below that line in the sand So we're not too interested necessarily at this moment.

So we're not interested in this first part, that's all data related, we're not really interested. What we are interested in is if the marker does move back to this red line which we've created, we are interested in a potential unwind of the delta. Now we can see that delta gets all the way up to 615, marker comes back, we see a little bit of accumulation, then we start to see a little bit of imbalance on the south side. Marker comes back to test it very briefly sits below the line okay so like i said to you previously what you will tend to see is you will tend to see the market sit on both sides of the line and trade it out it tried to do this okay so we can see very briefly it did try and and fill this out but ultimately it happened so quickly i think we only traded as we can see they only traded 920 contracts in Okay, so ideally this is where we would have executed in and around that area Obviously, we'll be selling on the break of that low Looking for an extension stop above the absorption zone profit once the market ultimately takes out the Delta or Extends upon the low. Okay. That's our first example. So our second example. We look at is the WTI oil 20th of December 2017 Well, we can see obviously a really really high volume surge here Market has an aggressive down move quite an aggressive delta real technical bias in the market and a real key line in the sand posted Now note the market obviously begins the process of auctioning below that line in the sand So we're not too interested necessarily at this moment. However Once we get back below those key pivots, we could see the market does provide us with a potential for buy opportunities For the Delta unwind we can see that Delta obviously shifts from all the way minus one thousand three hundred all the way to positive", "ocr_text": null, "visual_caption": null, "metadata": {"chunk_idx": 11, "frame_refs": ["output/UNIT_14___Strategy_9_Footprint_Delta_Position_Unwind_1-6/frames/scene_0005_mid.jpg", "output/UNIT_14___Strategy_9_Footprint_Delta_Position_Unwind_1-6/frames/scene_0005_end.jpg", "output/UNIT_14___Strategy_9_Footprint_Delta_Position_Unwind_1-6/frames/scene_0006_start.jpg", "output/UNIT_14___Strategy_9_Footprint_Delta_Position_Unwind_1-6/frames/scene_0006_mid.jpg"]}}

This is the positioning unwind So I'm going to fast-forward this for you show you what it obviously looks like on a chart the initiative So we can see obviously the market on the candlestick, best place to look, we can see a little bit of sell-off coming in the market, and market sells, sells, sells, a little bit of a wash-down, a couple of stops, nice imbalance there, market tries to go back, but I'm just going to move a little bit further on to the point where we're about to get some form of an unwind. Now again, obviously you can watch this video through from start to finish, apologies, Okay, so we can see in terms of context the market in terms of volume We've seen a real pickup in volume here real dark shades now on this five-minute rotation Not the cumulative Delta. Okay, really negative. This is quite negative for the euro minus 1,000 Ultimately our line in the sand we can see market sold off pulled back to this area You can see it rejected once twice three times Now once we took it out, let's just go back a few frames. So once we take out this little area Let's see what the markets reaction is Okay, obviously, again, this line in the sand doesn't necessarily coincide with the previous day's low. It just coincides with the market that tried to sell off, so we could see a real technical sell-off there. Real buyers, one-directional, higher volume, higher delta, but prices couldn't go lower. Ultimately, those prices became, or they came under water as soon as you got above those 38s. And we can see that as soon as we got back above those 38s, 39s, market went I'm just going to fast-forward this forward a little bit so you can see a little bit of obviously aggressive buying coming in there Continuation and obviously a break of the high as we unwind the Delta remember obviously with regards to straight strategy We stay in until either the Delta is fully unwound or we take out the extreme of the day Okay, the next strategy we're going to look at is the oil WTR on the 29th of November and in this example Again, we're now looking at a rotational chart and again, you can see really out, you know on a rotation chart We can really see the momentum and the flow coming into the market real aggressive volume there as well as Delta and accumulative Delta So this is a substantially large Delta on the day.

Yeah, is an unwind of this potential Delta We can see that the market reversed very aggressively the lows and continued in that direction building a Delta now What we're going to do is we're just going to come back a few seconds and we're going to have a look at this line in the sand. Now bear in mind we obviously spoke about things like single prints and low volume errors. So we can see obviously below these 08s that was the point where we obviously were just above for instance imbalances as well as single prints lower down.
