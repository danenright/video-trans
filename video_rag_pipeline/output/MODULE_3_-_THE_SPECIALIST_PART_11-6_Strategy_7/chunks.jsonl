So let's get into it and let's just talk a little bit about trending trade strategies. So firstly, we spoke a lot about control identifiers in the momentum series and what's is that the control identifiers will all be existent. So a lot like we saw a lot of them in the momentum series, they're going to be in the trending series as well. Then, very important, when we do have, not just a trend day, but trending strategies, note all time frame participants are trading in the same direction. We spoke a lot about these participants in module two, and it's important to understand that when a trend day is there, we are seeing not just the day trader, the algorithm all trading in the same direction. And it's this sort of confluence of timeframe participants trading in the same direction that creates the very aggressive nature that is trend. Now, another important aspect to definitely talk about is, this is an infrequent occurrence. Trending doesn't occur that often. Sometimes it could be 5% of the time, sometimes it could be 25% of the time, but markets don't trend as much as they do, as we would like at least, and most of the time they are spending consolidating and bracketing. However, I'm going to show you some of the key characteristics about being able to pick up on a potential trend day early on. Then, in terms of the emotional aspect, I want to deal with this first because it's important to understand the emotions, not just in the trend day, but in all the trending With the idea that we don't trend very often, we tend to see when a market does trend, we tend to see almost, you know, traders being a little bit, almost upset with themselves or almost a little bit sort of down on themselves, feeling like they've missed out on the massive opportunity and understanding this is important because it's okay to miss the What isn't okay is, number one, to go against the trend day, but more importantly, number two, is to become aggressive and suddenly start mismanaging your trading because you've missed the early initiative. What I will say in general.

And that is the key to not just this strategy but to all trending strategies. Do not panic. The market will give you a chance to hop on the trend. Now, what's important, again, also to discuss is the risk element. In terms of money management, you can afford to have a slightly skewed risk-reward, and the reason is that if there is perceived trend in the market and you've seen all the characteristics, you have to remember trend by its very nature equals a lot of opportunities, so a lot of potential rewards, so don't be afraid to have slightly bigger And again, factor that into your emotional analysis. If you're someone who doesn't like wide stops, well you need to try and sit down and visually understand why it is you're taking these wider stops and learn to manage that accordingly. Then also, in terms of expectation analysis, don't forget that when a market does begin to trend, it occurs for most of, not just the session, but for a couple of sessions. So again, you need to expect this trend to stay in the market for some time. Don't just jump off the boat because suddenly we're seeing a little bit of a pullback in the trend. So again, factor that into your expectation analysis. What we want to talk about is the phases of trend, the various different phases you'll find in a trend. The best way to talk about these phases is to actually graphically depict them. So we've got the early phase, the mature phase and the late phase. Now I'm going to use a basic consolidation pattern to explain to you the different phases. Now let's say the market for a couple of months has been moving between these barriers Now, once that market eventually breaks the consolidation bracket and begins to move out and trend, showing a lot of control identifies, momentum, volume, and volatility, that is regarded as the early part of the trend. Once the market has done its move and has its first pullback, and this can be a couple of days after, but once it finds those responses of sellers, in this example, the second leg up or the second initiative move is our maturing phase of our trend.

Once the market then has a second pullback and then extends for a third time and starts to see a lot of two-way overlap, that is our late part of our trend. Now, the importance behind understanding this is at which point are you in the trend. So a trend day can come anywhere, guys. It can come out of nowhere a lot of the time. But the important thing to understand when you see it is at which point or at which And the reason is, if we are at an early phase, we are likely to see a very different price response than if we are at a late phase. Now I'm going to show you two different types of example. One will be, you know, maybe a more early phase and one a more mature phase. And you will see, obviously, the reward and the aggressiveness of the move looks a little bit different. The important thing to understand is that depending on where you are, early, mature or late, this will effectively tell you the strength of the trend and how aggressive you need to be. So just some of the basic characteristics of a trend day is first and foremost a little price overlap. So as you can see in this example, note the lack of overlap in price. So the market barely overlaps until we run into some responsive buyers and the market That is very typical in a trend move. Then, a pure lack of respect for levels. So what you'll tend to find is that as you map out a market, when it starts to trend, the reference points are almost completely ignored. They're almost disrespected.
