In terms of the current footprint, just a quick note here, do note the imbalance sitting in the middle there, again what we do tend to see in the strategy called accumulation and distribution, ultimately, or sorry, absorption and auctioning, we do tend to see these imbalances whilst we are forming that sideways price response. key elements of the strategy of the two variations, at least, is this sideways type price response but what we're ultimately looking for in essence is some form of a darker shading at the extremes and that's kind of what we can see already if we start on this left rotation here note the dark extreme shading so what what in essence we are seeing there is sellers come down to that price point but they're being met by a buyer that's absorbing all of the potential liquidity being sold. So at the low there we have got a buyer taking all the liquidity. The market then bounces and we go to the extreme side and the extreme sides we can see the same thing darker shading this time however on the top side it's the seller that's taking all of always look, and again a lot of the time it might just be you know complete noise, but always look where the heavier liquidity is being taken.

So what we're doing is we're looking now for the clue, we're looking for something that tells us that the nature of the market has shifted and we've seen quite an aggressive change in the dynamics of the market. So that's what we're trying to keep our eye out for now, is some sort of a shift Keep in mind, obviously, one of those clues could be the break on either side of this, i.e. suddenly we see initiative above 16s or we see initiative below 06s.

So instead of the sellers taking all the buying at the high, we suddenly start to see the buyers absorbing at the high and vice versa, sellers absorbing at the low.

Let's talk this through So we can see markets come back down again towards that 06 area where it will not initiate below. We can see again still relatively subdued price response, no real shift in the dynamics. But this is now obviously the fourth rotation within the previous three rotations. So we can see this elastic is coiling and coiling and coiling quite aggressively. Okay, so suddenly there's a note, note a little bit of an imbalance there. Okay, I'm just going to pause that slowly, note the imbalance so we can see obviously markets come back down. Quite a thinning out of trade. Now what we want to see is if this is going to follow through, okay. This is the first time we've seen this. We've seen a little bit of a shift in the dynamic and note straight away 122 at the sixes. Note the sellers are now becoming more intentional at that price where they would not become intentional previously. We can see 136 traded.
