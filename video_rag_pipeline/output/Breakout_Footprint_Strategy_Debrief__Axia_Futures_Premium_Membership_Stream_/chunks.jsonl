Now I spoke to you and I said the key is the breakout of the inside day, but the real key, and this is something, I'm very excited to let you guys know that the Footprint course is on the verge of launching, and one of the things we really really dealt through every one of the 10 trade strategies, was identifying that clue. In a nutshell, the footprint is hands down the single most important tool that I have and I think that most traders have, simply because we can ultimately pick up on nuanced shifts and that's what the footprint is for. It shows you those sudden changes. A market will only break once an initiative comes in, once a large influential participant comes in and initiates. Now you can see that initiation in one of two ways. One is the price ladder and obviously you can pick up on certain changes in the price ladder, but the other is the footprint and I'm going to show you what that change Okay, so here we have the gold footprint. This is a five-minute rotation. Note, the market went into sideways mode. Now this is so typical. This is classic, like a textbook example. Markets will always, let me rephrase, the best breakouts come when markets consolidate ahead of the break. That's a real golden rule of thumb. If you observe breakouts for a couple of years, you'll recognize the best breakouts always consolidate ahead of the break. Now, the first observation, note the lack of initiative at these lower prices. So what you can see is that every time the market came to this lower end of the day, no one wanted to be a seller, 29 by 0, 26 by 0, 68, 2 lots, no one wanted to initiate. Suddenly we get this imbalance, this is the first clue, we get this imbalance and Now, the real clue, and we spoke about this quite extensively in the footprint course, this is the real clue, yeah, it's this little three boxes, yeah, between 17 and 17.2. Now, I'm just going to share it with you, take a picture of it, but what looks very different, yeah, and this is where the footprint is so fantastically revealing. color of these boxes, but it's the change in the participation. In other words, in every one of these previous rotations, sellers would not commit to lower prices. Suddenly, what did sellers do here? Sellers committed to lower prices. How do we know? Because suddenly there was 360 lots traded at 17.2, there was another 320 lots traded at 17.1.
