What I'm going to do is I'm going to just briefly explain how market profiling originally came about, but then more importantly I'm going to give you the advantages of using the volume profile instead of the traditional value area that was used back in the days. And I would like you to make up your mind as to what you think is more important. Briefly, profiling in the beginning when it was first created as a visual chart, it included the most important pillars of auction theory. These were price, time and dispersion of trade. The original value area included the dispersion of trade over an area of prices known as the value area. This area shows where 70% of trade has been facilitated. However, as volume became more important with the expansion of the markets and market participants, traders wanted to add an additional element being volume. In modern day profiling, we now have a fourth element, and those four will include not just price, time and dispersion of trade, but also volume. So the basic if you look at a basic distribution which you have on the chart in front of you as you can see the volume area is nothing more than where 70% of Trade is facilitated in a distribution now The important thing to understand is not whether it's wrong or right to do one or the other, it's about sticking with one or picking one and then sticking with your methodology. So let's look at some of the advantages of using volume as a preferred choice for your value area instead of the traditional value area. The first one. Most participants nowadays have converted to using only volume value areas and I'll explain to you why. Using volume value area means we can incorporate all the different time zone sessions into our analysis Now what I mean by that if you look at some of the the key US markets for instance the US Equity index the S&P 500 or the Nasdaq or the US bond market Nowadays they're trading almost 24 hours So the key question you have to ask yourself any trade that is done outside of the cash put session How important is this trade? That's the question you have to ask yourself. Now being able to use volume as a guide instead of just traditional values You're able to almost use a relative benchmark because we're in the low or in the in the time periods when there's no cache session and very little volume, this will be depicted on a chart.", "transcript": "Let's now have that discussion about the traditional value area versus the volume value area.

However, if there's high volume outside of these cache per session hours, at least that's telling you there is something genuine going on. So using the volume instead of the traditional will sort of almost allow you to be able to use your charts 24 hours as opposed to just certain sessions. The next benefit, volume shows actual intention of buyers and sellers. As change occurs with price moving, buyers and sellers need to react with volume, hence showing their intent. In other words, we can use volume as a key gauge for the intention of buyers and sellers. What do we mean by that? In other words, as price is changing, buyers and sellers are going to transact Now, at certain points, certain reference points, we're going to see higher volume. At certain reference points, we're going to see lower volume. By having this additional element, we can make better decisions about what buyers and sellers are actually doing. The next benefit is using volume instead of time as a key determinant for fair value. We have a metric that can be used to make relative comparisons and that's one of the key highlights guys. Volume you can compare on a relative basis, whereas time, because markets are now pretty much 24 hours, it's not as easy to compare over a 24 hour session because sometimes you have no one in the market. So using time is not the best relative tool when in comparison to volume. Therefore when talking about the volume value area from this point or the value area, I will always be referring to the volume value area. I will no longer refer to a traditional value area as I do not believe this is beneficial in this era of trading going forward. Let's now have a look.
