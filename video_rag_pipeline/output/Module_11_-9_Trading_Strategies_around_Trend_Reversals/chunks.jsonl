So the strategies are firstly, the accumulate distribution and sculpt, the in and out. We spoke about this in the absorption pattern, so you can review those videos back in the absorption module section when the market approaches an area, loses its current speed or there is a shift in the personality of the price ladder and as it meets those new areas when you get into those areas all of a sudden you can either have a core position or you find a buyer in a five tick zone and you sculpt around that zone and you sculpt around as long as the buyer still exists either on the on the sell side or the buy side once you're observed again that clear observable price personality change so that is there's a there's a strategy of in and distribution or an accumulation on the distribution zone where you can sculpt in an art or you build your core position.

Especially from the size of a size management perspective. I'll keep on saying that it's the size management that is key How do you distribute your clip? How do you work your size because the best traders are the ones who don't have one static order they buy here and they sell there the greatest traders in the future space on the price ladder of traders who understand how to manipulate their size and are great money managers on their prices out of knowing when to have the right size on at the right time and when to have very little size when things aren't going their way.", "transcript": "Okay, as always always the most exciting part of the course after we go through a bit of the theory where I'm literally talking through the key considerations but then it's already the practical element that consolidates learning because during the practical explanation you're actually seeing we're actually drawing your attention to what you should look for on the ladder and that consolidates the learning and once we we direct your eyes where to look well then when we give you the exercises to consolidate that learning your eyes are becoming more well trained and more attuned to picking patterns for, in this instance, trend reversal plays.
