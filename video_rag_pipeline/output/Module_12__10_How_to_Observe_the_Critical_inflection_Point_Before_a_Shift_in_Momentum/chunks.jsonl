So it's really important through experience and through logging and watching the markets consistently that you always identify. It's so important as a momentum player that you always identify that key inflection point and ravels itself. So whether you're trading a very minute time frame, the 5 minute time frame and you're seeing a 50,000 contracts or 100,000 contracts locked in a 5 tick range DAX market and you know the moment it's been trading between tens and twenties and again a hundred thousand contracts in the moment it triggers 21 you know that is the inflection point so as you see approaching 18 you see the volume pick up you start buying a little bit 18 so buying some at 19 and the moment it trades 21 there might be a little bit of a stop towards the upside but you observed that that subtle change on the price that and that's why that that that really Strong focus on the ladders is so important because you want to know where those inflection points and just remember your ability to pick up Inflection points is a real function and a product of your observations day in day out of where markets really move from a really tight-knit zone to a very fast, aggressive state.
