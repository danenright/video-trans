Again, later on I will show you how you can set up your profiles, how you can manage your profiles, adjust them according to how you want to view them, and utilize them in such a manner that you can get highly effective information out of them. So with the open price illustrated with an O and the closed price where the next TPO opens. So note, what you're seeing here visually is nothing more than the previous distribution except we've now opened it up to view every single TPO or every single 30 minute TPO that occurred over the course of the session. As you can see, each one begins with an O and each one closes where the next price Now, the reason we have a look at the individual auctions and why they're important is that we are able to see strength and weaknesses within each auction that takes place over the course of the day. So sometimes a lot of traders will just merely look at their profiles closed up for the entire session and they miss a lot of information that is happening within each one of the auctions. So it's important to find a balance between opening up the profiles and keeping them Note, viewing the auction process in this manner will illustrate four key points. The first is, when either buyer or seller is in control, it can last for a few TPO's. Now, as a rule of thumb, I have a little bit of an expression or a saying. When a market is moving in one direction, it's a lot like a big ship, a big tanker, oil tanker coming into a harbour. just like the markets. The markets very rarely turn around and very aggressively reverse in one direction. So by opening up the profiles we're able to see the individual auctions taking place. And when a buyer or a seller is in control it takes quite a long time for it to actually eventually turn around. knowing this is extremely powerful information because it means that even if we wish to go counter trend sometimes we just have to be a little bit patient for our trade to play out. The next reason that we want to illustrate it this way around is that we see most of the two-way trade occurring where price is being accepted and the lease trade where price is being rejected. So, by opening it up, we can see where the market accepts price, where buyers and sellers are happily transacting with one another, and equally we can see where buyers and sellers", "transcript": "So now that we've seen the volume profile as an entire distribution I'm now going to show you how we can open up the profile and view each single auction within the day's distribution so what we're going to do is we're just going to split the profile per auction.
