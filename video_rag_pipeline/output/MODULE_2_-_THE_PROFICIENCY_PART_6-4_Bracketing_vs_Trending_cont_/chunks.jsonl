It's all co-mingled so it all occurs over time. Now this is what we're going to talk about is almost that transitioning between bracketing Straight away, what we're going to talk about is that, remember, price is simply an advertising mechanism. We've spoken about this, we've spoken about the elements of price, time and volume. Now, certain prices or advertisements, they attract new business and sometimes they're successful at attracting new business and sometimes they're awful at attracting new business. And don't forget, the purpose of the market, the reason the markets were created, was to facilitate trade between a buyer and a seller. So what we have to ask ourselves is the very question is, how good is the market doing its job? So, remember, any breakout from a balance area, from a consolidated area, from a bracketing area, this signals a revaluation of value, in other words, the market participants are trying to revalue what they deem fair value. Now, at this point, when we start to break out of, say, a bracket, all timeframes are engaged. Why? Because we should only see initiative-type response once we extend beyond the bracket's It's crucial to understand because when you do get the breaks of these sort of bracketed areas, you're going to get repositioning or new business, new positioning in the market. And that's why sometimes the breaks can look extremely aggressive. Alternatively, sometimes you get these aggressive reversals. And we're going to talk about these trade opportunities because the important thing the break point or the juncture point where the market decides we want to reprice or we fail to reprice because there's so much activity in new business it means there's new positioning so either it goes and continues with the trend or it fails and reverses and that gives us very unique trade opportunities so let's then and then yeah what I want you to do is I want you to imagine volume as a force now for the market and we want to move away from a bracketed area or from an area that's been traded out for some time, we would need to see excessive force, so almost relatively very high force from what we've seen in the previous periods, whether that's days, weeks or months.

That's the important thing to understand. If price exploration does not have force and volume then the expectation is that price will be pulled back toward the value area. So important you understand this basic concept. Now, once the auction is underway, rather than attempting to predict future prices, we instead observe as the market discovers future prices. So crucial. I see so many younger traders looking at a chart and they look at a chart from the perspective of where have we come from and where are we likely to stop at a given future date. They're almost looking at the market and trying to preempt what the story might be living in the present and trading the story as it's occurring. I'm not suggesting that going counter-trend the markets is a bad thing. What I am suggesting is that there is a time and a place to both go with the market and go against the market and that's why we spend a lot of time developing our strategies based on objective analysis because that's going to help us take on trade opportunities. Not that we're guessing or not that we're thinking where a market might do something but rather we're making good educated decisions based on factual information provided by the volume profiles. As traders, we continually assess the force and the health of the auction process in order to identify asymmetrical opportunities that can provide optimal trade location, and more importantly, trade location with less risk. So ideally, in an ideal world situation, what are we looking for? If we're a momentum trader, we're looking to be momentum traders when there's a high Equally, we're looking to be sort of almost, not necessarily fade traders, but we're looking to go counter trend when there's a lack of momentum, which is suggestive of a high probability trade with less risk. That is the crux of it, guys, is finding the optimal strategy based on the conditioning of the market. Just in the charts, as you can see, we're talking about positive and negative skew.

So what I'm trying to illustrate to you there is that when there is positive skew, when there's non-symmetrical type markets, that is when there's a higher probability or a not necessarily an aggressive trending manner, but at least there's a high probability to either move up or move down. And that's what I'm trying to illustrate is if you can identify when there's a high probability to move up or down versus when there's a high likelihood we're just going to keep balancing, then you can employ some very effective strategies and you can reduce your ultimate risk. Note, a bracketed market has already confirmed auctioning on both sides whilst bracketing is still busy confirming. The trade strategies used will vary in both instances. In a bracketed market one can be passive on entry as other influential timeframes are responsive, where a market that is trying to bracket has a slightly skewed risk Therefore, we take on more risk preempting a bracketing market than a bracketed market. So all I'm trying to say to you is very simple. if a market has established itself as a bracketing market. In other words, we have clear areas where we're finding that there's resistance for buyers to buy higher or initiate higher, and sellers respond. And then equally on the flip side, sellers initiate at higher prices and then buyers respond at lower prices. So if there's clear, defined bracketing already, then as traders we want to initiate passive, and we allow the market to come and tag us, and fill us in, and we respond to those higher prices and to those lower prices. if a market is still trying to bracket, it's still trying to show the parameters of a bracket, then there's a little bit of a higher risk preempting that little bracket. So what we then need to do is we need to wait and allow the market to show us its hand, show us that actually it does want to bracket before we start initiating trade. So that's all I'm trying to illustrate is the difference in odds or the difference in risk that you're taking when you to form some form of a bracket.
