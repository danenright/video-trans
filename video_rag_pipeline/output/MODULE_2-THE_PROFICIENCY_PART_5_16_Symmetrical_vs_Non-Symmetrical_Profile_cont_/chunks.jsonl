As you can see in the example provided, we have a very balanced distribution. Now remember what we said, a normal distribution is where buyers initiate and are responsive So, by this very token, when the market is distributing, we can see that the odds are very evenly split as to whether we go up or down. Now note, one of the key things to point out when a market is very heavily balanced is that playing for momentum and being very aggressive looking for momentum breakouts to the upside and to the downside can be quite a risky play when the markets are in balance. out of balance type profiles. These will be profiles or markets that are trending. Now note, trending is when all 5 timeframes or all 5 timeframe participants are trading in the same direction as you'll remember from Module 1. There's very little responsive type trading, therefore all timeframes are in agreement of direction. and hence any response of action taken is likely to eventually be overwhelmed as the initiative continues. We will talk a lot more about trending markets as we move further along. Note then, another type of out-of-balance type shape is what we call a P-shape, Short covering is where the shorts cover their positions by buying out of those positions. Now note, initiative selling, so shorts, they run into strong responsive long time frame buyers. These buyers are responding to lower prices being advertised. The buyers then force prices higher and the shorts that are still holding their short positions will then buy out of those shorts and prices will continue to move higher. Those prices will continue to move up until we run into fresh responsive shorts. The other type of out of balance type profile is a B shape or a long liquidation profile. In the B distribution, buyers this time, they run into aggressive initiative sellers. So we have longs in the market that keep buying higher prices until they run into Those responsive sellers keep selling, and eventually the buyers are forced to liquidate their longs by selling out of their position.", "transcript": "Let's continue our discussion now of non-symmetrical and symmetrical profiles.
