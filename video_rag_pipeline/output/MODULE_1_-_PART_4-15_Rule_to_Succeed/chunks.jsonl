It's so important that you can relate trading to something that's important to you. I'd like to go over a few of the key takeaways from that video and we can see how the Navy, we can relate trading to the Navy in so many ways. Personally, I like golf a lot and I found that you can relate golf to trading almost perfectly. But anyways, let's go through this video and see what some of the key takeaways were. The general talks about starting by making your bed. Pay attention to the small things and accomplish them perfectly. So every morning when you get up, get up at the same time, start with the same routine, have discipline the minute you open your eyes. If you do that, it will become a habit not just in your daily lives, but in your trading. Don't do it alone. Find those families, those friends, the community, the colleagues. That's what we are for, mentors. That's what the AXIA membership is all about, is being in a community of like-minded people going through similar things as you. If you can find these kind of people, hold on to them, don't let go of them, because this is going to be tough, you're going to need all the help you can get. Fair for all. Markets don't reward age, race, culture, intelligence, beauty, height, but they reward the size of your heart. That's an important thing to understand. You don't have to be smart to be a trader. What you do have to do is have one hell of a passion and a love for what you're doing. If you have that, it's a vital ingredient to success in trading. How well you prepare determines how well you succeed. So crucial. I see so many guys coming in Monday morning, they haven't even prepared their thoughts over the weekend. They haven't even thought about what happened in the past week. They're so unprepared, they start off on a Monday, they lose money, and they spend the rest of the week trying to get that back, simply because they were not Make sure you're prepared. Being prepared is in your control. So make sure you're perfectly prepared. Constant hurdles that will push you to quit. Remember guys, hurdles create mental strength, they create resilience. You will fail, and it is going to be painful. But that's the only way you're going to learn. The important thing is, are you willing to keep moving forward? You ask any successful trader, you ask me even. I've had some hurdles that I had to overcome in order to continue as a trader. There's been times I've wanted to pack it up, there's been times I've wanted to give it up, but at the end of the day I know those experiences have made me that little bit stronger, that little bit wiser and definitely more resilient.", "transcript": "I really hope you enjoyed that video.
