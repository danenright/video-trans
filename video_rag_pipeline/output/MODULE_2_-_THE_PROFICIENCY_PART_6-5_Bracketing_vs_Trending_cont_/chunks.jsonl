Now remember what I said to you, the objective of any market is to facilitate trade. So when prices move higher, is it bringing in new business? or is it getting responsive sellers into the market and that's the question you have to answer yourself because if it's facilitating new business there's a high probability that we're going to get strong initiative and momentum continuation, whereas if it's cutting off activity it's likely we're going to get some form of reversion type opportunity. So if high prices are increasing the bidding, so more buyers coming in, the risk of being If short, the odds of suffering a loss are greatly increased. So again, just coming back to that concept of just knowing whether or not we're bracketing or trending can increase or decrease the odds of success and obviously compounding potential losses. So that's important to understand and that's why we spend quite a bit of time understanding the principle and the premise behind bracketing and trending markets. So what you've got is the example here. It's a candlestick chart. and not necessarily a volume profile, it's because it's a good way to illustrate what we mean by looking at bracketing and trending. More importantly I can show you what the volatility will look like or the range expansion will look like when we do have a little bit of initiative and then return back to bracketing. So looking at examples you Initially, the market spends in this little box, in this blue box, you can see the market just almost pinging off a lower bound and an upper bound, a note. Not support, not resistance. So what we get is we get buyers that respond at lower prices and they then initiate until such a point as they run into responsive sellers. When they run into those responsive sellers, they then back off, and we then start to see sellers initiating until they run into, again, responsive buyers. So that's what we get initially, a little bit of two-way trade, and we keep pinging between these two points. Then all of a sudden, you can see three relatively aggressive candles as we move Now note, the first thing to understand is, look at the size of the three candles. Now the reason I like to talk about candles in this respect, and I will show you this in profile examples later on, but look at the size and the length of those candles. Note how they're the biggest three candles we have in this entire, you know, since the beginning of this chart. Now that already shows us initiative, it shows us that we're seeing a little bit of control factor coming in on the short side. Again, straight away, one of the clues you need to pick up, when a market moves outside", "transcript": "So the example we've used is basically in an upward auction we assess whether higher prices are cutting off activity or creating increased interest.

Now that already shows us initiative, it shows us that we're seeing a little bit of control factor coming in on the short side. Again, straight away, one of the clues you need to pick up, when a market moves outside of a bracket, remember what we said, we need excessive force to get the market to move away from what it deems fair value. And then as you can see, remember, we get the initiative from the sellers until such a point as it runs into responsive buying. Once it runs into that responsive buying, sellers will then ease off the initiative Note then we move into our second bracketing example where the market just trades between two points. Now what I want to point out is that when we do have initiative moves, and this is a little bit of a clue or a hint as to what we're going to be talking about in strategies later on, but when there is initiative, that initiative point or that break point becomes an extremely important pivot in the market that sellers or whoever initiated needs to defend. So as you can see, the first time we retest that break point or that dotted line, respects it and we see not just buyers back off the initiation, but we see sellers stepping in and initiating fresh shorts again. So again, we can see the market enters a second bracketing example. Finally, once we take out that key pivot where the seller's initially initiated, no other market then moves back into the original bracket. Now again, this is not something that's new, you're going to see this very very often, you know the market moving in and out of bracketing areas. The important thing to understand is when are we bracketing and when are we initiating or trending. So again, we then have our third box, another example of bracketing between buyers and sellers. Again, note how when we saw the initiation in the first box, that key level where that dotted line is now acts again as an area where we have responsive buying. So what was initially sort of almost called support then became resistance and has now become support again. And then again, note how once we take out that area, we get initiative again from the sellers until they run into responsive buyers, etc, etc, etc. So this continues to occur over a period of time. So what I want to point out and illustrate to you is that trade location, we're going to talk a lot about trade location in the coming slides, trade location defines our risk. If we are looking for buy side trades, in that first box for instance, in the first bracket, if we're looking for buy side trades towards the high, momentum trades, we're taking on a lot more risk. Equally, if we're looking for sell side trades towards the bottom of it, we are taking on high risk.", "transcript": "the beginning of this chart.
