A large order is an abnormally large order sitting on the order book. As you can see in the image at 167.44 there's a 2,300 lot. If you look during the the entire length of the buy side orders, there isn't an order greater than 600 lots. So this 2,300 lot is almost four times larger than any other order on the order book. So extremely, you know, this sits out like a sore thumb. A large order always sits out like a sore thumb. Then the next question is to try and determine what type of trading strategies you want to really deploy. A basic definition is you can have a rudimentary definition of twice the size of all the other orders. So in this context, although we have a 2,300 lot, if that was a 1,000 lot, that would by its definition constitute a large order. Now how do you measure the genuine nature of a large order? Now what's really important is The genuine nature meaning that that large order actually wants to be filled So it's not a flip or it's not a flipper or a spoofer who doesn't have the intention of being filled it is actually an order that wishes to be filled and Most importantly is the duration if the large order has been sitting on the order book at that price For the entire morning or see it you saw prior to futures open at a key level then that has a strong strong nature if you just see in large order appear out of nowhere at a at a price while the market is trading, then there's a strong likelihood that that is not a genuine large order. So a large order that has been on the book for large duration has greater odds of being genuine. Also, what's really important is the contextual approach or the speed towards the order. The further away the market is away from a large order and the faster the market moves towards it, the more the market will possibly react. Whereas if a market trades above that large order for a period of time, the greater propensity of that large order could be traded out. But if it's a genuine order, well then there are a whole myriad of different trading strategies which we will be speaking about in a video after we look at the trading Now remember the main reasons for large orders is there's countless reasons for large orders but a lot of them are for genuine orders from a broker who's looking to execute for his client at any particular price. A lot of times those large orders happen of certain events which we'll talk about a little bit later on but there is a whole bunch of reasons for large orders and we'll look at that in the next slide.", "transcript": "Okay now let's define what is a large order.
