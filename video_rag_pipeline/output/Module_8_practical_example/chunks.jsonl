You can see the order book is really the size of of the orders on the order book throughout these prices is between 20 lots to around 90 lots on either side so no significant large order that we're able to identify at this moment but what we'll be looking for is a large order as you'll see as i press play again on the video you will have three strategies that will be a trading here. Firstly, the front run explosive grab. So the moment we see that large order come onto the book. So if we see a large order come to the book, we can start positioning and start putting our orders just above that large order between a one to three tick or two tick position above the large order. Or if the large order comes on the sell side, one to two to three ticks below the large order on the sell side. Now. for that front run explosive grab what you're looking for is the moment you enter the trade the moment you get filled you want to try and enter it with a rather aggressive size and you want to take Anything between one to four ticks on the trade or one to two ticks on the trade Depending on the genuine nature of the large order a large order that appears out of nowhere in the oil market That's above 500 lots is a generally on balance of average a Significant order especially when the market is moving around quickly as you notice when you're trading Products such as the bund and you see orders flashing in and out in a large orders that are twice as", "transcript": "Welcome to our large orders trading strategy video in this video We'll be looking at the oil market which is depicted here at this on the left hand side this ladder over here And the market is currently trading at 50 29 19 lots bid at 1529 with 28 lots offered at 50 30.
