So to summarize in terms of the tool the two basic elements of setting up the tool that we are going to utilize throughout this course is number one obviously the rotation And within that rotation factor, we spoke about two different types of rotations. The first was a bar type rotation, which is predominantly a time-based rotation. And then the second was the point and figure. Now once we spoke about the rotation, we then moved on to looking at the different types of source footprints we can create. And we have five different footprint sources. The second that was the volume the third was the imbalance source the fourth was the profile source and Lastly we spoke about the most important one which was the third times Mask source now most importantly guys as I mentioned throughout this course and all the examples We are going to utilize both sets of rotations for different strategies in terms of the source we are predominantly going to focus on the bid times by ask as well as develop a specific strategy utilizing the imbalance. Now just to note the reason we don't utilize the delta volume profile is very simply because you can get all of that information within the bid times by ask source. Okay so that's what we dealt with in unit two so you should now relatively easy to utilize, you should be able to move between the different markets quite easily. Last but not least, I really, really want to ensure that you can not just utilize the tool, but also that you understand the intricacy behind the tool, and that's what this drill is all about. It's going to test that you actually understand what it is you're exactly seeing in that footprint tool. You know, if it is simple, great. That means you understand the basics of the tool You know, that's fine. Brilliant move on to unit three if however, you know You still struggling a little bit trying to understand the tool and this will be a perfect drill session So straight into question number one or as you can see on the left side here I've got a hypothetical footprint. So this is our footprint on the left and on the right side We've got the prices now I want you to answer the following question so question number one what is the volume traded at each price so tell me what is the total volume traded at", "transcript": "Alright guys so welcome to this drill by session before we actually move into the drills and the sets of questions let's first just briefly have a little bit of an overview of exactly what it is we dealt with throughout Unity.

What color would it be? Red or blue? Question number four. Which shade should each price be? Now remember we spoke about the number of shades and how that is the relative amount of volume traded in each price. So go and put each one of those prices in either a light shade, a medium shade or a dark shade. Now just again to cast your memory back. that there's only two colors that it can be that's red and blue and from each one of those colors you're going to have a light a medium and a dark shape okay question number five what is the cumulative Delta over these six prices and question number six identify the imbalances between prices Okay, I'm gonna give you a little tip there. It's diagonal in nature. So again, if you don't get this, that's okay I will do a guided tuition session with you after this and your bonus question And I don't know if I've mentioned this but if you do get this right, congratulations But what does the zero represent at price 42? So what does that zero represent at price 42? pauses video now take a moment go through those questions think about it and when you come back and you start playing again I'm gonna go through each answer individually right guys so back into it now let's move straight on to the answers I hope you found that useful the first thing is what is the volume traded each price so very simply as we spoke about the total volume is simply what was traded what was sold at price 45 versus what was bought at price 45 and we can see the sum total of volume is In the second example, we can see it's very simply 710 contracts. We then have 367 contracts, then 650, then 1,030, and lastly 1,350, okay? Nice and straightforward. Hopefully you got that right.

Nice and straightforward. Hopefully you got that right. Now, the next thing is what is the delta at each price. you simply subtract the two from each other so 300 in the first example except you now need to add either a positive or a negative delta so remember the delta is merely the interaction or who won the battle at that price so the first example we can see there was more buying at 45 than there was selling therefore it will be a positive 300 delta and likewise for the next and it was positive 190 delta. We then have minus 145 delta, as the sellers won price 43. We then have positive 650 delta, positive 870 delta, and last but not least, negative 650 delta. OK, so straight away you can see, obviously, that the delta varies at each price. Now, the next step was, which color should each price be? or blue. Now the color just simply shows us whether it was buyers who won at that price or sellers who won at that price. So when the color is red, obviously the sellers won and when the color is blue, the buyers won. By one we mean there was a positive impact on the delta. So very clearly, very easily, we've got a blue, a blue, a red, a blue, Okay, and then the next question is what should each shape be at each price now this again If you found this a little bit tricky, that's okay Important thing to understand is that the shades are based on the relative amount of volume Okay, so an algorithm is designed effectively to go and add a shade based on the relative volume So it's one prices volume relative to the next the price that has the darkest color will ultimately have the most amount of volume versus the lighter. So if I was to draw this on a scale it's simply just the least amount of volume toward the most amount of volume. So the darker the shade the higher the volume at a price and obviously counter the lower the volume the lighter the price. Okay so again if we were to put this into a shade it's very simple. We can see the volume, trade of the total volume and we can simply see that the highest volume is 1350 therefore that will be a very dark shade. We can also see that relatively speaking 1100 is a relatively dark shade. On the flip", "transcript": "We then have 367 contracts, then 650, then 1,030, and lastly 1,350, okay?

On the flip side we can see that 367 is a relatively low volume relative to all the other prices therefore it will get a light shade.

Now again, don't worry too much about this, we will spend quite a bit of time on this when we move on to imbalance strategy, but very simply we can see there are some imbalances and this is definitely one of them. imbalances always go in that direction not in the opposite direction and the imbalance is none other than when there's a really big relative difference between buyers buying a price versus sellers selling a price so we can see buyers bought 650 at 42 versus sellers selling only 80 at 41 as a result there's a really big imbalance between how much was sold at the best offer okay and obviously an imbalance obviously you know one man's imbalance might be another man's you know non-imbalanced so it's important and we will talk about this later on to distinguish how much is an imbalance but as a basic rule of thumb i like to work on you know numbers anything five times okay so five x anything that's five times for me would be considered an imbalance so straight away we can see no imbalance there potential imbalance there no imbalance and no imbalance so if you got the answer right that that was the imbalance congratulations okay then to answer the bonus question very simply what does the zero represent at price 42 it's very simple guys and again don't stress too much about this I don't think I", "transcript": "so again if we were to put this into a shade it's very simple.
