Now there's a whole host of reasons why we utilize the replay functionality but some of the major advantages why we professional traders use it and as well as why you should use it are as follows. Well, first and foremost, we use it as a form of pattern recognition. Now it's imperative that over a period of the day, you will see the markets tend to move quite a lot and there's quite a lot of noise over a period of the day. And a lot of the time when you get stuck in the very short term time frames, you forget to observe the patterns that the market is actually showing you. So first and foremost, it's a very valuable tool for recognizing various patterns that Secondly, we utilize it as a form of deliberate practice. By being able to speed up a process, we can practice various execution methods, we can practice sitting on trades, and we can practice various principles that we understand about the volume profile. Then the third reason is for principle training. By principle we mean if we for example were to see a strategy occurring in the market A lot of the time, we don't execute this strategy and complete the principle 100%. Our execution is not always 100% perfect. By being able to speed this up and rewatch it and go over that principle a number of times in our head, we're able to practice our principles but also improve our execution of those principles. Replay series. Now let's play this video through and I will take you through the basic premise and the basic understanding of the volume profile. Now as you can see the market opens where the big O letter is, so let's highlight that so you get a very good understanding of the opening price. So the big O there and the big O there, that is where the market has now opened. Now the market you're looking at is the German bull market and it is on the 15th of September 2016.

Now as you can see on the left side we have got what we call an open auction profile and on the left or the open auction volume profile and on the left side we've just got a traditional The reason we utilize both profiles is very simple. Firstly, the traditional profile. We utilize this mainly for shape. It's important to be able to see the shape of distribution, not just as it's occurring over the period of the day, but also over maybe various days and even weeks and months. So we utilize a closed profile to determine shape and structure. In terms of the open auction volume profile, we utilize this so that we can get a better understanding of not just the evolving auction that's occurring constantly over the period of the day, but also when there's a sudden shift or change in the auctioning between buyers and sellers. Now note, when we can view the market auction rotation by auction rotation, we And that is predominantly why we actually open up the distribution to view each auction individually. Now as you can see just a number of things to point out.

Now, remember, each one of these TPO's has a high and a low. where the market opens, that is the open of the auction and obviously the market is constantly moving over a period of the day advertising prices up and down as you can see on the profile.
