Now, again, we have dealt quite extensively with trending markets, speaking about the characteristics, speaking about the understanding as to why it's important to very early pick up on when a market is trying to trend, and also the understanding of how a market trends with initiative and responsive type price behavior. So just some of those characteristics again, note that a trending market is where we have are in agreement of price direction. Note we have a lack of pullbacks in a trending market and a lack of two-way trade and we do have a very early identifier when it comes to trend days and that is the previous day's extreme point. Now note markets tend to leave single prints early in the session showing early confidence from either sellers or buyers. Now remember, as we spoke about some of the characteristics of a Trend A, we also spoke about some of the strong or the string or the strong control variables. Now what you would typically see in a Trend A is all of those strong control variables to see, you know, weak control variables being exhibited, and if they are, they tend to be like almost, you know, free gold lying around, because those you can be particularly aggressive on as you know there is a strong conviction for prices to either move up or down. Then the market pauses at extremes as it runs into responsive sellers at the high and buyers at the low. So note again what we typically see in a trend day is aggressive initiation until we run into responsive other time frame players and then the market has a bit of two way trade before then resuming the initiative move higher or lower. Note, it is a high conviction day type with very early identifiers. Some of those identifiers can include tails, volume value areas that have very little overlap as well as low volume areas, single prints and other strong control variables. So make sure you understand those strong control variables as those will be quite evident Let's now turn our attention to the second of the profiling patterns.", "transcript": "So the first of these three patterns would be the trending pattern.
