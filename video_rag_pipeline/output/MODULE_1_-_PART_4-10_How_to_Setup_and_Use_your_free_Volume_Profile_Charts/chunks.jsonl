Before we get started, just note that this trial will last 28 days only. With that in mind, if you haven't already downloaded the software, the link will be provided on the LMS system. Once you've downloaded that, do ensure you also download the setup file so that you'll be able to see the exact setup that you can see in front of you. Now, some of the key things we're going to look at with this overview will include volume profiles to start off with, both full and split profiles. We'll then also take a look at basic candlestick charts and some of the tools you can use, as well as then the basic footprint chart. Now let's get started and as you can see on the left side we have what we call a traditional volume market profile. and some of the features you'll be able to do with this include the following you can merely scroll up and down left and right across to view patterns that have passed. You can then also right click on the profile and add splits this will allow you to see the individual auctions If you just want to see various auctions that have taken place at some point during the day, you can click on the letter which you want to separate from the rest of the profile. This will then separate all letters that come and occur after the letter you've separated. Note if you want to remove this again, simply right click and remove splits. Now you would have noticed that the scale on the right is not set to show each individual you can adjust this so that you can see all the available information. Merely just click on the left, scroll up to get to the to go the one way and then scroll down to go the other way and make your profile smaller and larger. Now note, if you want to get a simple line you just click on the price and this will have a pop-up line. You can then find the location you want to put that line and simply click on that price. Now it's important to be able to change the colors of these prices and so to do that you right click on the line and you go and set the horizontal line color. Now the reason it's important to be able to set different line colors is so that you can visually see when something important is approaching. Now I tend to have a basic four color set and that would include red lines for key reference points, I'll then have orange lines when I want to identify value area I will then have pink lines in order to identify weekly highs and lows and lastly I will have blue lines to identify various tail single prints that are left in the profile as you can see", "transcript": "Welcome to this market delta charting overview.

So that's just some of the basic color lines that I would utilize in my volume profiles. Now that we've spoken about the closed profile, as you can see in your second set of profiles, those are your open profiles. So again, note that just shows us the individual auctions that have taken place over the period of a day. Now as you can see in the top of the chart, you'll see that you have four different markets here. Those are the four markets that you'll be required to find examples of to include into your playbook. Again, simply just click on it and it will automatically take you to the close profile of the WTI oil. So that's the basics with regards to the volume profiles. Let's have a look at the candlestick chart now. we can make it smaller and larger, we can scroll left and right. Now, first things first, if you want any specific tools simply right click and add a study. There you can find Bollinger Bands, Average to Range, Volume, Moving Averages, all the same tools you'd find on any traditional charting package. However, note The purpose of this course is volume profiling. It's not to give you a whole range of different other tools, so don't be tempted to suddenly start populating your charts with various types of tools. Focus on the volume profiling and the strategies that I have provided Again, if you do want to, however, have a look at a bit of a shorter term time frame to see how a strategy played out on the shorter time frame, you can merely click at the top of your task bar and go to change interval or chart interval and adjust it according to the time frame you want to see. That is then the basic candlestick chart. Note this little arrow in the bottom right. This will simply move the chart to the latest piece of information. particularly if you are doing some backtesting and you're scrolling all the way left, all the way left, you do sometimes want to quickly be able to come straight back to where the market is currently trading. Then with regards to the footprint chart, again this is not imperative to have or to understand for the volume profiling course, but I've included it because it's a very popular tool to be able to see the interaction between buyers and sellers at those key points. Note, if the strategy talks about 163.60 being an important area in the market, go and have a look at how the buyers and sellers interact around that reference point. This will allow you to start to develop basic understanding of price response in the price ladder.", "transcript": "reference points, I'll then have orange lines when I want to identify value area I will then have pink lines in order to identify weekly highs and lows and lastly I will have blue lines to identify various tail single prints that are left in the profile as you can see with a Y print in this example.
