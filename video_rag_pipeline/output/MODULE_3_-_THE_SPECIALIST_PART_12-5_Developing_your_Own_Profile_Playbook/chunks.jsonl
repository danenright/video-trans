But what I want you to understand is, once you've finished this module and this course and complete your playbook that you'll be able to take with you, it doesn't stop there. The game doesn't end there. That's just the beginning of the game. These 11 strategies I've developed with you in your playbook is just the beginning. Your objective is to take those 11 strategies, learn them, replicate them, find them, And then slowly but surely, as you learn more and more about the markets, develop your own strategies, update your own playbook, constantly evolve not just your playbook, but yourself as a trader. Keep developing. Now, once you've mastered the principles of the market profiling tool, it's time This playbook is vital to your future success, because it ensures you're constantly recognising and understanding the principles. Just like a professional athlete practices every day, so too we must practice every day with constant updates in our playbook. Remember guys, trading is a marathon. It takes a couple of years to develop edge, to develop real skill, so you have keep updating it and keep developing this playbook. Now one of the important questions you have to ask yourself and decipher, and again not many traders know this or have the answer to this question is, where do you feature in the markets? Where is your likely edge? What do I mean by that? When I started as a trader I was very much a broker before a trader. So when I looked at the markets I looked at the markets very much from a fundamental perspective, from a trend based I never thought that on a day to day basis you could actually make money in the markets. By becoming a day trader, all of a sudden I saw a completely different market. I could see how markets could sit tight range bound for so many days and yet there was still opportunity. And then sometimes when there was a trending move, I could see how large a time frame bigger players entered the market. So the question you have to ask yourself and be able to answer is, where do you feature? I'm not going to say you cannot be a jack of all trades, but I am going to say you probably don't want to be a jack of all trades. You don't want to be a scalper and a long-term trader. And the reason is because the objective of a long-term trader and a scalper are almost opposite. Yes, we all want to make money, but the manner in which we do and the strategies we employ will be very unique and very different. Are you a long term trader that goes with the trend? Are you an intermediate swing trader which looks for point to point and bracketing and moving out of various ranges?", "transcript": "We've been developing your playbook over the last three modules.
