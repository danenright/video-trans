Like all seasons you're not going to be wearing a coat in the height of summer and you're not going to be wearing your board shorts in the Antarctic. You need to know how to dress up appropriately given your environment and the same as with the market. You're going to deploy certain types of strategies when you have certain types of the speed of orders that are going through the market. So by understanding the different market velocity environments in conjunction with passive order movement, is the foundation to developing an arsenal of price ladder patterns. Market velocity is not concerned with the size of the bids. bid or whatever you see on the offer, it's actually what's going through the market, what's being traded, and therefore it's the interaction of the bid or the offer after what we've seen or how we see dynamically in real time, the orders going through the market. So, you know, and I'm circling my finger like this because that's how we effectively represent orders going through in the marketplace. So as the market spins its orders through, how the buyers digest the orders or how they don't digest the orders, next price or how the sellers digest the orders or how the sellers just step back and the market just continues towards the upside so it's really understanding.

How the how is the market absorbing the trades that are going through is it absorbing it and the market is becoming static in one Area where there's lots of trades, but it's not moving anywhere. Well, then this this really builds up a pot of energy that's ready to burst itself once the market ties out of trading in a particular zone. So remember, it's the speed of exchange versus buyers and sellers, the level of auction activity and the progress of the auction. So depending on how it's auctioning will determine how the market will progress based on auction market theory. going through the ladder, the more the market will continue to auction in that direction until the auction tires out.

Not as one or two people start putting their hands up and so the exchange starts slowing down and as the exchange starts slowing down so does the market start retreating back until it finds a great level of auction where every buyer and seller is meeting at the An equilibrium price is dynamic.
