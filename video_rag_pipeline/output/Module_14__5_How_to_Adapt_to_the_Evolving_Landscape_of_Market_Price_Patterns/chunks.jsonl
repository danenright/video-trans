How are you going to show that you've learned those lessons and implement the right, the correct, the correct steps and strategies and protocol for the next time? What's your critical feedback loop? So if you're buying the opens on an overnight event, as we spoke about in the previous example, and you've lost on the two previous opens, well, what's the critical feedback loop? What are you observing that's that's kind of changed this pattern? And if you start writing that down, what happens the next time you you'll be able to actually make profit the other way. So it's this critical feedback loop and that really maintains itself back into your routine and it continues to a professional development, your critical feedback loop, your routine, and then you're always adapting and evolving because you'll always be the quickest to observe when something is not working. A lot of the traders who have no routine, who have no professional development, who have no critical feedback loop, what essentially happens to them is that they'll be trading a month in trade, And every month end train they're making less and less money But they still believe that it's a great opportunity because the last few years they've been making money on it until the one month It completely doesn't work and they give back two years of earnings on month ends simply because they haven't noticed that gradual diminishing return of the", "transcript": "Okay, so we've really been speaking about You know how the opportunities come and go but the really important question is how do you adapt with the evolving? landscape of market price patterns, and we've really given you a lot of a lot of templates, a lot of key methodologies for certain areas to observe different types of water flow patterns and really this is kind of recapping again and I'm going to explain this a little bit more to you and as you can see on this slide we talk about the background being the brain and really we're using a cognitive protocol to understand how you develop these core patterns how you make sure that you evolve as these core patterns also have their own lifespan and time span and how they all change so really you kind of start with and it's all encompassing circular effect it's your routine being being religious being consistent in your routine and your routine having various various elements from understanding psychology to your skill and affects your emotional element but as long as you maintain a constant routine you're able to really you know extract what opportunities are in the market make sure that you always have this professional development that you know every week you review your week and you look at well where did you lose the money where did you do well where you're going to focus your edge and your attention when you when you lost the money.
