Now note, these are very, very rare to see. So there's one key characteristic that defines a market as a normal day. We have an extremely wide initial balance, so that initial hour of trade is substantially bigger range than normal, so well above the average range. Now the easy way to identify this is to make sure that you track the range of the initial If on average you find that it's roughly 10-15 prices, the day you have a 30 or 40 or more price range, you know there's a high probability we are going to get a normal day type. Now, the important thing to understand about a normal day type is that we tend to spend the entire session filling out the initial balance. So straight away, if you know there's a high probability that the market's going to spend almost the entire session within the early established range, straight away you can develop some fantastic trade opportunities with very good conviction, knowing that Now, note, as we can see, long time frame participants have a strong reason to react early on and this early reaction is what creates the very wide initial balance. The important clue and the important understanding is that on a normal day, there's no extension of the initial range and it's a higher probability outcome that it's going to stay that way As you can see in the chart, what we have is the blue line is the, or the dark blue line, that is our initial range. Now in this market you can see it's a particularly big example. What's important to note then with the light blue bar is that's the value error. So we can see that the value of the day, of the entire session, was accepted within Also important to note is the very strong opening tail that the market exhibited in this market, so it's quite often that you do see tails on these normal day types. So again, remember, if you see an extremely wide initial balance period, that could be an early clue or an identifier that we are likely to have a normal day type.
