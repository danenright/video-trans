So yeah, what we're going to talk about in part six is we're going to focus on firstly bracketing and trending markets. We're going to spend a little bit of time just understanding this principle and I'm going to point out why it's absolutely crucial that you can define when markets are both trending and bracketing. location, and why it's important to understand that the price where the market is trading based on where it has come from is crucial to understand. The strategy development as well as success is highly dependent on the trade location. And then we're also going to spend a little bit of time talking about some of the various open strategies that trade strategies based on that. So let's get straight into it and let's kick off and talk a little bit about bracketing and trending market and what we actually mean when we refer to a market either bracketing or trending. So first bracketing. A market is said to be bracketing when it exhibits two-way trade between buyers and sellers. Now as you can see a very basic example is what we have on the right. Let's first look at the handwritten drawn. drawing. As you can see the market is bracketing between what we like to call support and resistance. Now what I do want to point out guys is when I refer to support or resistance I don't necessarily mean you know at support buyers are buying the market or at resistance sellers are selling the market. I merely mean this is the point where either sellers are stepping in resistance or buyers are looking to take profits at those same resistance areas. by bracketing, it's when a market starts to trade between two pivots and it respects those pivots and keeps bouncing between them. Then, buyers initiate buying at lower prices near the bottom of the bracket and will continue to show initiative until they begin to run into responsive sellers at higher prices. Once prices reach the top of the bracket, sellers will become slightly less responsive. Why? Because prices are advertised at a premium and they will then begin to initiate short side trades until we reach fair value. This continues to occur over a period of some time, whether it may be minutes, hours, days, even sometimes weeks and even years in certain markets. Now note, this can occur across all timeframe participants and all timeframes, so it's not just exclusive to longer term timeframes or some of the influential participants, but", "transcript": "Welcome guys, and hopefully you managed to get everything done in your playbook in part five without much hindrance.

Now note, this can occur across all timeframe participants and all timeframes, so it's not just exclusive to longer term timeframes or some of the influential participants, but sometimes even algorithms will play these bracketing type plays and we will talk a little bit about this as we start to develop strategies at a later point. Now, note, markets tend to bracket 60% to 80% of the time, depending on fundamentals. So when there's a real lack of fundamentals in the market, we do tend to see a lot of the sideways trade. Now, if you want good examples of this, I remember distinctly watching the e-mini S&Ps over 2012, 2013, and 2014, when the Fed had employed all these QE strategies and Ever since the back end of 2014-2015, we've just seen most of the US equity indices moving sideways, moving in a bracketing-type formation. As you can see, even the most well-known markets can spend a long, long time, months and years, within these bracketing ranges. Now note, we will have three examples of different day types of bracketing, and we'll talk about those in a bit. So, when a market is in a bracket, the views of all the relevant time frame buyers and sellers are very closely aligned and the odds of moving higher or lower are about equal. Crucial, crucial, crucial, you get that guys. When a market's bracketing, being aggressive, looking for momentum plays at the wrong time can be extremely costly. it'll cost you so much money preempting a break or preempting momentum, the best thing to do is just wait for the break, wait for the momentum, and then begin to partake. So crucially understand that when the markets are bracketing, the odds of continuation are very, very low, or the odds of momentum are very, very low. So if the odds are low, you're going to require extremely high reward to justify that trade. on three or four or five attempts of this, taking this momentum play, it's going to fail and then eventually it does occur and all you're doing is making losses back.
