I explained why Don't forget, there's no exact science. It's a principle, therefore always manage a risk. Make sure that if you want to adopt these principles and really learn them, you're going to have to practice, practice, practice. Through observation, through experience, experiencing lots of different situations, you're going to learn more about these principles and ultimately what they all mean. Obviously don't forget all the rules of thumb as I go through them, make a note of them, write them down. These rules of thumb are rarely, they come from years of experience but do bear in mind they are just generalizations. And obviously each principle will be seen in the number of strategies that we're going to do. We're obviously doing ten of them in this course and I will identify all of these Okay, so the first principle we're going to talk about is relative changes. Now, I've briefly introduced this relative changes concept earlier on in Part A. So what is relative change? Well, with regards to the footprint tool, it's particularly important. Note, obviously, we only use relative change or speak of it when we are using time-based not the traditional rotation. Now what's wonderful about relative changes is that A relative change is nothing more than a shift in dynamics, and that shift in the dynamics provides us with a clue, a useful piece of information. If I can relate this, it's like watching a poker game. It's like that big call where two players are facing off against each other and suddenly maybe the one player rubs his nose, completely out of character. telltale sign. That's all that the relative shift is. It's the shift in dynamics and ultimately when those dynamics change, the clue. This is what I'm going to show you through every one of the strategies. I'm going to show you that little clue that validates the trade strategy and the opportunity. Okay, the footprint obviously reveals the subtle changes which provides opportunity. Again those subtle changes are the clues and it's those dynamics that we need to learn and ultimately take advantage of. Now in terms of some of the relative changes that we're going to utilize throughout this course they're going to include volume, delta, price and time. Always, I'm referring to the relative volume, the relative delta price and time. Just in terms of price, I think that's probably the least obvious. What I mean in terms of relative price is the dynamic or the price response, okay?", "transcript": "So welcome back to part B of unit 3.

So we can see the relative shift from, say, these two rotations compared to this Now in terms of where we're going to talk about relative changes, it's going to be throughout all of the strategies. Let's move on to the next principle then, liquidity. Super important. Not many people understand the concept of liquidity. So the first thing to say is, is it a liquidity user or a provider? A liquidity user is someone that is taking the contracts, whereas a provider is someone Now, it's so important because someone who's using the liquidity is going to be using it for very different reasons than someone who's providing it. This is where that sort of nuance comes in. If you want to start to learn to interpret a lot more about the interaction, you need to be answering this question of what was it? Was it a liquidity user or a provider? Are they passive? Are they aggressive in nature? The underlying reasons are ultimately super important. determines velocity of price and interaction between buyers and sellers. So what do we mean by that? Like I explained earlier on if a market is rotating higher and trending higher the amount of liquidity or the availability of liquidity will ultimately determine the velocity of price. So the velocity is just simply the manner in which price is moving between prices or oscillating between prices. Okay, now obviously if there's a lot of liquidity, we're not going to see much velocity. If there's little liquidity, we're going to see those shifts in velocity. Now, the underlying objective of the market, don't forget, it's to provide liquidity to those who require it. Never forget that. Obviously, we're all speculators and I would assume everyone taking this course is a speculator, but at the end of the day, the big players, the big participants, they're there to utilize liquidity and to hedge themselves and to take on spreads and manage their books effectively. market is to provide liquidity to those who require it.

Now, as a general rule of thumb, illiquid markets will trend until they find liquidity. Okay, so let me rephrase that. When markets are trending, if they are illiquid in nature, they will continue to trend until they find that liquidity. Okay, why? Because, well if the market is trending, everyone is ultimately buying, they might be buying to be long or they might be buying to but ultimately that buying will continue to persist until such a time that we run into the desired liquidity and that's where the concept of liquidity premium comes from in other words in illiquid markets okay take for example in the housing market in london okay let's say all of a sudden all the buy-to-let guys want to get out they want to sell their properties well guess what the property market is extremely illiquid So how do they get out? Well, they have to keep lowering that price until such a time that someone is willing to be a buyer, i.e. provide liquidity. When they find that liquidity, they can then offload that asset and ultimately we get consolidation within the market. Now note, breakout liquidity will be very, very different in a balanced market situation Okay, so when a market's breaking out, ultimately we're going to see a lot less liquidity being provided. Why? Because we're breaking out of key resistance, there's far less responsive sellers coming into the market, providing that desired liquidity, therefore we're going to have a far more illiquid situation and prices can therefore move a lot quicker. Obviously in terms of a balanced market situation we can see that both buyers and sellers are providing liquidity to the market and therefore markets can remain relatively subdued and sideways. Now in terms of this concept just very briefly I've got a nice little chart for you. Now, if I was to highlight illiquidity, I think one of the key sections is, yeah, now, again you're going to look at that on the footprint, you're going to say, oh, okay, that looks like an imbalance, which it is, okay? So in illiquid conditions, we tend to get a lot more imbalances. Now note the market auctions higher, it leaves this, you know, imbalance area within the rotation, and once it finds the liquidity, it then starts to rotate Now note, obviously we spoke about, briefly about imbalances, so I'm just going to show you a neat little trick, but again, don't worry too much, we're going to spend a lot of time on this in the imbalance strategy section.", "transcript": "liquidity and to hedge themselves and to take on spreads and manage their books effectively. market is to provide liquidity to those who require it.

Note once the market gets back below that low volume area, or imbalance area, what does it do? Okay, that is one of the key strategies I will teach you in the imbalance section. Imbalances do get filled out and traded out over time. Okay, so obviously we can see a couple of low liquid areas on the footprint, but ultimately that is the concept of liquidity, which we are going to apply across all the strategies. Now, my single favorite part of the footprint chart, okay, delta pocket positioning. I'll explain this to you quite nicely. So very simple, I'll show you on the chart in the next slide, but very simple, Delta positioning arises from initiative taking. So I'm going to draw this for you, there's our initiative from our buyers. Now, as the buyers are stepping in and buying, they are leaving a trace, they're leaving footprints in the market and they're showing the nature of initiative, in other words they're taking initiative to drive prices higher. As they're moving prices higher, obviously as prices move up we are going to see a little bit of response of selling, a little bit of response of selling, but ultimately they are accumulating positions on the way up and those positions they will need to defend at some point. As the delta accumulates, price must make headway on the objective. In other words, as prices are rising and more buyers are coming into the market and the delta is rising as well, we must also see price responding in that direction. Otherwise, like I said earlier, the component of time tells us that the longer buyers that makes them more vulnerable okay so if buyers keep buying and buying and buying and buying but they can't move the prices higher eventually what's gonna happen is prices are gonna turn back over and we're gonna see those positions unwind quite fast okay so that's the that's the concept of that's the concept then of the of the market delta positioning now test pocket positions.

But note when the markets do come back around they're always going to test these position pockets. If they hold obviously markets will continue higher, if they begin to fail we're obviously going to see the potential for a footprint delta unwind which again I will talk about later. So let's see what this looks like then on an illustration. The first thing is obviously, as we can see on the chart, Delta Pocket Positioning appears with darker regions. So we can see price moving, so we're seeing the initiative, but then as we're seeing the initiative, we're seeing these little pockets of positioning. So this is effectively, we can see up here, we get some shorts in the market, the market then moves down. So go from dark Then again, we can see obviously the market still has these light colors. We see a bit of pocket positioning, and dark colors, a bit of light colors, and pocket positioning again. Okay, now all the pocket positioning it is, is it's simply the sellers are initiating here. They're running into liquidity, running into buyers who are responding to those However, the sellers are still selling, eventually the buying gets overwhelmed and again the market then initiates lower until it finds that liquidity again and we get that pocket positioning. Now, it's these little pockets of positioning that often get retested over time and if they can hold on to those pockets, the market will then continue in that vein. Obviously, the market provided a nice little pocket here, the market came back, tested that pocket, went back to the low, came back a second time, tested it again and that pocket howled ultimately before we then got the extension to lower prices. Now very interesting, just note in terms of delta and volume, with pocket positioning and this type of initiative, obviously we're always going to see a pick-up in volume, nice strong relative pick-up in volume, and we're also always going to see the delta respond. Why? Because the very definition of delta pocket positioning is that within the zone, and this zone, and this zone, there is more selling than buying. pocket of positioning.

If a market is unable to move prices in the direction it's going over time, eventually themselves. So that's why it's so important that you know when a market is long and you feel this initiative you always want to make sure you're keeping an eye on time you know as a good basis of you know how how are the buyers progressing how are the sellers progressing. Okay now note In terms of the positioning, when there is liquidation, this is the key to understanding a delta unwind. When we get below that point, so let's say, for instance, the market had been initiating. This was our pocket position. I'm going to call it a PP, our pocket positioning. The market comes back down, ultimately, once we get below that point where the buyers or the buying threshold, we get below that point where the buyers are going to stop out. Note that stop out or below that point, the liquidation is not price-sensitive.

And it comes in the form of absorption. Now we spoke about absorption earlier and what it means, but ultimately just before we get the unwind, you'll always get a little bit of an absorption. So I'm going to show you the chart next to us. What you can see obviously is prices were rising nice and aggressively. We had the delta accumulating. We can see the cumulates of delta on the day was nice and high in this example in the gold. and all of a sudden the market begins the process of turning around.

I said you will always get the process of absorption before a before a delta unwind. And that's it there.

We unwind this Delta that's built up into the position and ultimately you can see if we look at the Delta on the day it goes from positive 1200 all the way up to positive 1600 and then very quickly reverses as prices sell off to the downside. Now note as a rule of thumb an imbalance created by a delta unwind will be filled out. So what do I mean by that? In the example we've created an imbalance here. Why is that imbalance being created? It's not fundamental, it's not technical, it's just simply about a short term positioning coming unstuck.

Okay, a bad high is where a market effectively transacts a high amount of volume at an Okay, so a lot of volume is transacted at an extreme point. Now the reason we call this a bad high and bad low stems from the original concept of auctions, which are what? An auction is to facilitate buyers and sellers between a premium price and a discount price. So by that very definition, we don't want to see a lot of transactional work up here, okay? Because if there's a lot of transactional work at a premium, that's not an effective auction and we call that a bad high. or a bad low. Equally it can also be where a market effectively tests or rotates a number of times on a certain price point and I'll show you that in a few examples.

Now note, a bad high or low constitutes an anomaly or a failure of a market to correctly facilitate trade. When we pick up on these anomalies, they always correct themselves. As a rule of thumb, anomalies will correct. But there is a caveat, and this is a mistake a lot of traders make, they don't have to correct straight away. They can take time. Now another, some of the other kind of anomalies you might have heard of are things like gaps in markets, okay? Gaps are an anomaly, all right? They do eventually get filled out over time. Okay, so that's one of the anomalies which is a bad high or a bad low. Now to represent that in terms of a candlestick, so you can see it, this would be something what we would call a bad low in terms of price. Why? Because we can see that this market gold has tested this price point once, twice, three times, four times, five times. Okay, so it's a really, really badly auctioned low and at some point the market is going to take that out and move lower. Okay, so it's very simple, what you can see in the first example is that in this market we transacted 240 contracts at the lowest price.

Don't look at every single price and say to yourself, what does the shading mean? What does that shading mean? It's about understanding the shading in general in each rotation. It's about understanding the shading around key points. If we have a key breakout, what is the shading looking like at that breakout point? Because it's that shading, that recognition of a potential pattern, that's what we're after because those patterns we can recognize over time in a number of examples. So, Delta Shading is the relative interaction at each price. Very simply, who wants to buy or who wants to sell more and why? That's what it is guys. Every single price here represents who wants to buy more versus who wants to sell more. This is obviously, as I said, the key element to the footprint. Now, because we can visually represent this, that's why we need to have some sort of an understanding of what the color scheming means. Now note, like I said, the color scheming doesn't depend on anything other than the strategy you're trying to execute. Okay, so you are going to see very specific color scheming when I show you the auction reversal strategy You're going to see very specific color scheming when I show you the imbalance strategy The key is for you to develop an understanding of what kind of color scheming you want to see Based on the strategy you're trying to execute Okay So, what matters most is considering the shading in the context of the strategy. Now, like I said with an example of a breakout, there should be lighter shading as definition of breakout suggests liquidity is a premium. So the principle of a breakout, we take out big resistance, everyone's a buyer, therefore there's no response of seller. Now, if we know that's what the pattern should be, when that doesn't occur, that's an anomaly. That's something we can obviously go and make a mental note of because in that instance that breakout might not be as effective as it should be. Okay, and that's what we're after.

As another example, when we are in imbalanced markets, you can expect large pockets of dark shading. Okay, so like you can see in the example here, we are in relative balanced area, so we can see dark areas, dark areas, you know, dark areas. Now, if we sat there and just started interpreting this as, you know, potential to buy, potential to sell, right, we're not going to go anywhere, right? And that's why, what we're going to do when we get to the strategies, is we're developing the strategy and then I'm going to show you what you should be seeing based on each strategy. Okay, so important thing to remember with shading, it will never be the same. Never, guys, it's never going to be carbon copy. There's just too many different strategies, too much noise for it to be exactly the same, but there will be very very unique similarities that exist and that's what pattern recognition is all about. It's about finding those similarities Okay, obviously the concept of Delta shading will be applied to all of our strategies. Just a brief word on the cumulative delta. Like I said when we set up the tool, the cumulative delta is simply just the delta being added up over all the rotations. So if every one of these is a rotation, one, two, three, four and five, the cumulative okay, plus the delta from rotation 2 plus the rotation in delta 3, 4 and 5. And what it does is it simply just accumulates it over the period of a day. Now the reason this is very useful is because it gives us a very very good snapshot of what the Delta is doing over the course of the day. Now what I am gonna say is be very cautious and I hear this a lot on our trading floor as well. People assume that because say a Delta is negative that the positioning is short. Now, factually that is incorrect. It doesn't mean just because a delta is negative that the market is short. From day one, get that out of your head because that's a very dangerous approach to take. What it does mean if there's a negative delta is it means that there has been more selling versus the buying. In other words, there's been more aggressive selling than aggressive buying.

What it does mean if there's a negative delta is it means that there has been more selling versus the buying. In other words, there's been more aggressive selling than aggressive buying.

Okay, is that if a market is trending and it's showing very clear dynamics in terms of price in one direction, as mentioned as a rule of thumb, you want to see the cumulative delta rising in the direction of the trend. Equally, if it's a downtrend, you want to see the cumulative delta getting steadily negative over time. In that instance, we can assume that the delta is reflecting the positioning. Remember guys, positioning means that as markets go up, we're seeing buyers enter and hold position. We're seeing buyers enter higher up and hold position. We're seeing buyers enter and hold up higher. That is what positioning is. Just because a delta is negative or positive does not imply there is positioning.

And a lot of people make this mistake, it's not the same thing. Because accumulation or absorption is a aggressive thing. It's initiative being taken, whereas consolidation is just simply noise. It's the market oscillating around the mean. The most important thing to be able to do is to differentiate when the market is doing this process of accumulation. and when it is just noise. So when it is accumulating, that's something we need to pay attention to. When it is noise, it's simply just oscillating and consolidating and we want to try and avoid that. Okay, now like I said, accumulation will have relatively high volume. That's the real standout clue.

So when you see this process of accumulation or absorption on high volume this coil eventually needs to trigger a movement in one direction or the other. Okay, and it's that trigger that we're very interested in because it provides, again, very good initiative opportunities. Now, again, like I said to you, I'll show you what the triggers are as we go through the strategies, but the important thing is that you're going to see a shift in dynamic. Now let's briefly look at the example and I'll show you the little clue here. What we can see again, the market spent a process of accumulating and absorbing. price action at the low and responsive at the high, again responsive at the low, responsive at the low, responsive at the high. So a lot of responsive type price action, no real initiative, suddenly, bang, initiative steps in. Now straight away you gotta look at that, you know, if you were just eyeballing that you're gonna see what the real clue that was there, okay. If you go and compare all of these rotations something really, really sticks out, a bit of an imbalanced low volume area that sticks out. Okay, so we get this low volume area, it breaks out of this previous little rotation, we get the extension again run into some real pocket positioning and the market then comes back, tests that low volume area, fails and continues in the direction of the trend. Okay, so that trigger there, it was a shift in dynamics, which is i.e. a nice little imbalance as the sellers stepped up and began the process of initiation. Now note the volume dynamic on the initiation, a lot higher, substantially higher in relative terms than the previous couple of rotations. Also note the delta shift, okay, not a great deal of delta shift and all of a sudden Okay, we almost see the delta doubling in relative terms over a period of four rotations. Okay, now note in terms of accumulation and distribution, this is the accumulation phase, and once it snaps, once we begin the", "transcript": "and avoid that. Okay, now like I said, accumulation will have relatively high volume. That's the real standout clue.

We see that responsive on the other side and once we take that out, we then continue in the opposite direction. The next principle we're going to cover is the exhaust of high and low and also known as a stop run. Okay, so in essence it's nothing more than stops triggered. Now stops can be triggered in a number of ways. Either someone can hit the market and they can take out a number of prices or they can begin the process of stopping down where they're simply just paying down, paying down, paying down. The difference in two is very simple, someone who hits the market, you're going to see something, probably not, but you're going to see a whole bunch of zeroes, so you'll see ultimately 230 times 0, 100 times 0, 80 times 0, 150 times 0. Now how this works simply, if someone is stopping out and they need to sell 1000 contracts, they're taking the liquidity at all these prices and obviously because they're selling 1000 contracts there will be no So again, as a general rule of thumb, if you do see a number of zeros after each other, not just one, but a number of zeros after each other, that simply shows you stops in the market. As you can see, obviously we do have examples here where we do only see one zero. That does not imply stops. That's simply just someone sold 53, but there was no buyer at that price.

That's simply just someone sold 53, but there was no buyer at that price. Now that you know that you can get two types of stops, note obviously when we do have this exhaustion high or low, it comes at an extreme point and most important, it comes after we've already seen quite an aggressive move. So all an exhaustion high and low is very simply the market's overextended itself, it's gotten ahead of itself and it's now, for lack of a better term, is now overbought or oversold. an exhausted market does not imply a low or high. That's a mistake people make. Just because a market's gone too low or too high does not imply that that's the top or the bottom. What it does however imply as a rule of thumb is that markets tend to take a break. So when you do have an exhausted market it always tends to take a break. Now That break comes from one of two reasons. One, is a little bit of profit-taking. So anyone short in this example wants to take a little bit of profits. Why? Because the market has exceeded the number of prices it typically would. Also, you get a lot of relative value strategies, particularly by algorithms, where once a market gets beyond a certain threshold or beyond a certain variance they do tend to then look to fade the market. So just bear that in mind, that is why we get the taking a break ultimately. Okay, now note, because of the excessive volatility, we will see exaggerated price response at extremes or within range. In other words, when these stops go off and we get the stop run, it's going to look quite aggressive. The market is going to thin out quite a lot and it's going to be quite volatile. That being said, obviously we will likely get the highest delta, the highest volume and the widest rotations as a result, for obvious reasons. If a market is stopping down and exhausting itself, there's a lot more time frame participants in the market, which by definition means more volume and obviously more volatility. But also the reason we have the most negative delta is very simply, if someone is stopping all the prices from here to there and they're only going to be a seller which means we're going to see a very negative delta in this example whereas if it was buying to the upside we'd see a very positive delta. Now note the market stop is defined by how big the stop is and where the liquidity is being provided. Now one of the biggest mistakes I used to make and a lot of traders make still today is they try to catch a falling knife.

When a market reaches this point of overbought or oversold there's likely to be stops in the market. Now, when a stop is executed, and I'll explain to you how a stop is executed. Let's say, this is the oil market, so let's say there's a 5,000 contract sell stop order. The moment he enters the market, to hit the market, he's going to take out as many prices required to fill his order, okay. Now we don't know how many prices that is, nobody knows, okay, because nobody knows Okay, so if there's a lot of liquidity, he might only require 10 prices to get 5,000 contracts. If it's a thin order book, he might require 30 prices. Okay, so by that very nature, you're standing in the way of providing liquidity, you're doing yourself an injustice. Okay, in this trade strategy, you do not need to get the best price. Okay, you do not need to guess. As you'll see in the strategy session, I'm going to show you how to identify this trade strategy and make money from it. But just bear in mind, the reason you don't try and catch a falling knife is because you don't know where that knife will ultimately stop. That's the key crux of what I'm trying to explain to you there. Now note, we will talk a lot about this in the exhaustion high or low strategy as well as the footprint delta unwind strategy. Now our last principle is all about color lines. Why do we use color lines? It's simple. You want to be able to or you use color lines so that you can easily quickly identify When you look at a footprint, you know, if you have different color lines, you can straight away go and say, okay, that's a high of yesterday, that's a weekly low, etc., etc. So color lines just simply identify a price. Now note, obviously you need to be responsible and keep it up to date, otherwise you come in the next session and you're executing off lines that are no longer relevant. Equally, keep it simple and effective and consistent. That's the mistake I see a lot of people make. in applying this process. This process will help you tremendously so do consider the idea of color lines. Now I'm going to give you a couple examples of the color lines I used and just to give you an understanding obviously when I did adopt this process it took me roughly I think about two weeks until it became a really good habit so what I suggest you do start off with a couple of lines, maybe three or four color lines, what they represent to you, maybe even something simple like a previous day high or low and start building a consistent approach to applying it.

As you can see there's quite a lot of pocket for high volume areas as we spoke Dark blue is for key breakout areas or as I mentioned in the last couple of slides where we have tail auctions Turquoise is for initiative where the initiative begins and again You'll understand this a lot better Why I utilize initiative lines when we get to the strategy on support and resistance or at least failed support a failed break of support and resistance and then lastly green lines for imbalances.
