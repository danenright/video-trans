will be looking at the core market They will be looking at how to set up your workspace for training central banks and the central bank events and then we briefly speak about how to design your price

were to change that and make it zero would see The orders come through so as seven lots go through you've seen that seven come through so the next order that we see Come into the market and maybe it

Now if you're trading the euro stocks as your exclusive core market then you'd have your euro stocks over here as the main page you'll have the S&P 500 right next to it as it has a strong correlation when the US global equity markets move they cause a ripple effect around the world and then you can have the DAX and next to the euro stocks because the DAX and euro stocks should move more or less in sync.

So therefore when I'm trading the European Central Bank I'm very well prepared for trading that mark and getting the most bank for bank information Because the interest rate from the central banks in effect the entire European bond market as well as the equity market and You want that as your main source for when you're trading the ECB? Central Bank, okay. So now let's have a look at if we were to trade the FOMC central bank and you'll use the same type of common template like I've just explained over here so let's just look I've just got another workspace over here this is actually a demo workspace so let's just have a have a look right here and so how I've prepared this if you're how you would set this up is, if you're trading, generally the most sensitive markets are going to be the interest rate markets in the USA. So the markets that you would have up, I would have whatever your core market that you're going to be trading on the day of the FOMC, you have a chair and you elongate the markets.

And what I'd have here is the 30-year market over here, the two-year market, the two-year treasury, and the five-year treasury. So two fives, ten thirties. So I see the entire curve and how the various parts of the curve are affected. So for example, if they come out and they surprisingly... increase interest rates, you'll get the two year moving the most, followed by the rest of the curve as the two year is the most sensitive to moving interest rates, but this is what we discussed in the other course we just showed you how to set up your price ladder space. Then what I'll also have is I'll have the short term interest rate market. So I'll start and then I'll move another three more months later, and then I go for every deck contract, deck 18 up until deck 19.

So this is how you'd set up your FOMC paper. This is a nice squiggly bit of Painting that I've created over here. So finally what I wanted to tell you So we've looked at how you set up central banks It would be the same for the BOE the same design looking at the UK guilt Market as well as the FTSE 100 almost exactly same template except you substituted for the UK assets So instead of having the 10-year notes you have the guilt market and you have the short sterling market You have the FTSE, but then you can still have gold and oil which are you know more globally denominated markets. Now for geopolitical events, we might look at a workspace but I'll describe it over here on this side. So if there is a theme that's running rich in the market and for example you trade, your market that you trade is the Bund and we're having a housing crisis in the USA, the financial crisis, so what you want to make sure is if that's your core You want to make sure you have the S&P 500 right near there, perhaps the Dow Jones, the money Dow Jones, you want to have the Japanese yen to see the risk theme.", "transcript": "and then I'll move another three more months later, and then I go for every deck contract, deck 18 up until deck 19.

So finally what I wanted to tell you So we've looked at how you set up central banks It would be the same for the BOE the same design looking at the UK guilt Market as well as the FTSE 100 almost exactly same template except you substituted for the UK assets So instead of having the 10-year notes you have the guilt market and you have the short sterling market You have the FTSE, but then you can still have gold and oil which are you know more globally denominated markets. Now for geopolitical events, we might look at a workspace but I'll describe it over here on this side. So if there is a theme that's running rich in the market and for example you trade, your market that you trade is the Bund and we're having a housing crisis in the USA, the financial crisis, so what you want to make sure is if that's your core You want to make sure you have the S&P 500 right near there, perhaps the Dow Jones, the money Dow Jones, you want to have the Japanese yen to see the risk theme.", "ocr_text": null, "visual_caption": null, "metadata": {"chunk_idx": 5, "frame_refs": ["output/Module_2-12_Building_your_Workspace_cont_/frames/scene_0001_mid.jpg"]}}

So you've got the Japanese yen over here, you've got the S&P 500, and you potentially have a commodities market, and then you also have the treasury market. So these, the housing crisis happening in the USA, so therefore the most sensitive the American market so you will have for example the treasury market over here and as news breaks out or the markets are being affected these ones will be affected first and as a result you're trading on the back of the markets that are most sensitive or most correlated to the geopolitical theme that's going through the markets. Now if during the European crisis were the the the peripheral bonds the Greek bonds the Italian bonds the The Irish bonds of Portuguese bonds, but on the ladder on the futures market. We have the Italian bonds So next to the bond you'll actually have your what's called the BTP ladder Which is the 10-year Italian paper and so that's going to be very close. You're going to have the euro dollar Currency because that's so important as European crisis was unraveling. So as certain events Do occur in the marketplace and as certain as certain geopolitical Events are really moving the market make sure you adjust your workspace accordingly So you gain the most information as close to your correlate as close to your core market So this is where you do the adjustment when there's no theme running through the market Then you just have your normal your normal workspace So always remember always make sure that if they're big political themes or typical events are moving global asset classes to adjust your workspace accordingly. So as the Greek crisis or the Japanese tsunami when the Japanese tsunami was happening you wanted to have your yen. Incredibly close to the bond because that was a market that was affecting Global assets around the world. So this is a brief introduction to How to set up your workspace and with the objective to gain the maximum information from markets that are going to affect your Market that your market is highly sensitive to and also understand of how to trade Correlated strategies that's something that we talk about in the other programs and our other and other training courses but when you can see a correlated marker movement, you can potentially see an absorption pattern on your ladder as the correlation breakdown. So thanks very much and I'm really glad that you have now done this part of the video and we will be asking questions.", "transcript": "financial crisis, so what you want to make sure is if that's your core You want to make sure you have the S&P 500 right near there, perhaps the Dow Jones, the money Dow Jones, you want to have the Japanese yen to see the risk theme.
