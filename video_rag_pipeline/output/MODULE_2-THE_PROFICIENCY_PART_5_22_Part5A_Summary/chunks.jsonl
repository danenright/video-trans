So straight away remember we spoke a profile or a distribution is nothing more than a which should be on this axis and volume which should be depicted on this axis. Now remember price is an advertisement, time will regulate that advertisement and volume will tell us how good is the market advertising at various prices and how are participants accepting or rejecting based on what's being advertised. summary of what volume profiling is all about. Then we spoke about the price ladder and I showed you the different elements of the price ladder. On the left side we had all our buyers, on the right side we had our sellers or offers and in the middle we had all our prices. Now the reason I showed you this is because I wanted to show you that whilst we talk about distributions being an auction process, equally when we execute we're executing based In the middle here we have various prices, call it 1, 2, 3 and 4, and at every one of these prices we have got buyers and sellers wanting to transact with one another. Now how they transact with one another is a skill in order to learn to watch. Back in the day, if you were to have seen the people in the pits or people talking about reading the tape, reading the tape is nothing more than just interpreting and understanding how buyers and sellers are interacting. Are they aggressive? Are they passive? Are they buying some and then selling some, trying to just manage the position? How are they executing? And that is why we spoke very briefly about the price ladder. quite possibly one of the most important principles that you have in volume profiling and also in the markets in general. That is initiative versus responsive price action. Now I'm going to go through that again with you and show you how the two fit with one another. So initiative is where we see aggression. We see a large institution, a large time frame player, someone who can influence price executing a position. on the market. Now, depending on how much liquidity is in the market is how the market will move in this example from A to B. So if this is our initiative move and there is very low liquidity, this buyer is going to have to look", "transcript": "So you guys are halfway through part five now, let's have a quick little summary and just make sure that you fully understand the principles I've dealt with so far in the beginning part of part five.

Now, If, however, this buyer can find liquidity, it may look a little bit more jagged, a little something like this. effectively we are still seeing the same thing which is initiative. Now there's a few key characteristics to identify initiative but the most important is that it's a momentum directional play. Now that means straight away any strategies we ever execute in this type of price action we don't want to be going against it and that's the key is that when you develop your initiative type price response or in responsive type price response. So that was the initiative we spoke about. Then what we spoke about was responsive. Now responsive is nothing more than players being brought into the game. So what do we mean by that? As these prices move higher up, what then happens is as price is advertised higher at this point, we see a responsive seller step into the market and sell it to the initiative buyer. However, once that responsive buyer stops responding to higher prices, the initiative buyer will then continue to buy the market up until he finds again responsive sellers. so forth and so forth, initiative buying until we run into responsive sellers. Now the degree of responsive selling is going to dictate how we move up. Little responsive selling and it will look aggressive. A lot of responsive selling and it will look a lot less aggressive and more grindy. So that's effectively what we were trying to point out. In another example, if we were to just illustrate response of an initiative, is let's say the market was moving in a sideways type formation. So the market was moving up and then it ran into effectively responsive selling. We then saw sellers respond to higher prices, anyone who was buying the market then turns Once you run into responsive buying, anyone that was short on the way down will then take profits and the market will look to continue to rotate until it runs into responsive selling.

We then moved on and we started to talk about symmetry.
