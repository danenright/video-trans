The tactic was outlawed in the 2000 dead 2010 Dodd-Frank regulation, but as with other forms of fraud, it's hard to prove the trader's intent. In this case, the intent to cancel the order, prosecutors must prove the trader didn't change his or her mind for legitimate reasons after placing the trade. So this is so important because as a trader, if you're putting in an order and then you're putting it because you're get a certain reaction from other market participants, well then you're not in that instance, you haven't created a spoof. So it's a very fine line of having to define what is a spoof and what is not, but you have to prove the intent. Now, we will later on, in this module slides, we'll be looking at a video of a spoofing pattern and then actually a trading strategy of how to trade around that. We'll be looking at the optimum environment for these trading strategies. They usually, you know, 80% of the time they occur in mid-range. So when they occur in mid-range away from other timeframe participants, that one, that liquidity hunter has the ability to effectively bully the market in his range because he's one of the the sole participant but when the market moves at into expansive state when they're multiple timeframe participants it's a lot harder to control the market was effectively you trying to control the order book in a in a range that isn't in a range that isn't highly liquid or there's a lot of volume activity going on.
