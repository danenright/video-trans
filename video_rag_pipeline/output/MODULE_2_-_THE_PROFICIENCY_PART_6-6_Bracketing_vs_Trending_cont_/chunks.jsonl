I'm going to show you three nice little set-ups, strategies, techniques you can use to observe and identify potential turning points. We will develop these strategies also further on the blackboard later on. Let's go through them one by one. So there are two methods, but three examples that we're going to talk about when we talk about potential turning points from a trend back into bracketing. Now the first one is the less frequent one, which is a loss of momentum. and all of a sudden prices are moving higher and higher and advertising higher and higher prices, all of a sudden there's just a real lack of interest to show initiative at higher prices. So it's not to say that buyers don't want to be long, it's just that they don't want to show initiative at higher prices. Now at this point volume simply dries up or the lack of interest in a new business dries up. Now we need that new business in order to continue to see the So, if everyone is fully committed and no one is left to participate, well then it's very simple. There's a lot of, you know, you'll have obviously the initial longs that bought at the beginning of the trend, you'll have more longs that bought sort of in the mature phase, and then you'll have some weaker longs that bought sort of at the back end of the trend. And those weaker longs are likely to be the first ones that will liquidate those longs and then we ultimately start bracketing. And this is the first sort of example that we will talk about when we talk about potential reversals in the market, and I'm going to show you examples and how they look in the volume profiles in the slides ahead. The next example is what we call an excess top. Again this is probably the most frequent kind of top, as I would have spoken to you about in Module 1, this is the kind of top where we see a tail in the market, or we almost see the market go from initiative, it runs into response of other time frame players and then quickly backs off as prices are being advertised at either a discount So the market makes a dramatic move higher or lower. So that's the initiative again This can be on on on I don't like to say lower volume necessarily, but relatively okay volume So nothing flash nothing amazing And what we then quite then what do you then see is quite a quick reversal and the setup I'm going to show you is called a V reversal or an inverted V reversal And so effectively we what we you know, we get quite a strong auction reversal process This can be done, it doesn't have to be on low volume, it can be on high volume but we tend to see this done on relatively average kind of volume. This is our second kind of top which we'll talk about.", "transcript": "Now we're going to get to the point where we talk about how do we identify when a market moves from trending back into bracketing.

This is our second kind of top which we'll talk about. So, just a note, an excessive reversal can appear to be on high volume, so it can look as though something crazy is going on in the market and there's a lot of aggressiveness and there's almost an aggressive trend. But the important thing to understand is that the high volume isn't on the excess. In other words, it isn't from the buyers buying up and initiating at higher prices, actually on these higher prices bringing in other responsive sellers, and again vice versa, obviously it could be to the downside as well. So it's those higher prices being advertised that bring response from the other time frame and that is what creates potential for high volume, but note again this doesn't have to be on high volume, it can be on low or higher volume. Now the more excessive and an aggressive version of this, you know excess top is this is and it's is it's what we call a strong excess reversal and how we identify between the two is very simple. When we get a strong excess reversal we tend to see a pick up in the volatility, so range expansion, we see quite a lot of volume and we see excessive prices. So we see a combination of volatility, volume and excessive prices, whereas in just an excess top we tend to see a pick up in relative volume reversal. So the big difference here is we see the volatility and the volume change quite dramatically. The reason we want to identify and differentiate between these two types is that when we have these real sort of excessive type, you know, tops being formed, you know, we get very strong reversals, but more important, the tops or bottoms they make become crucially important pivot points, and that's why we identify between the two, because a top that's made on volatility, volume and excessive prices is far likely to hold for a longer usually signal almost like the end of a trending market. So that's why we want to differentiate between the two. What we can say, which is important, and this is a phrase that quite a few sort of professionals like to use, is that highs and lows in market, in other words, longer term highs and lows, and again, I use the word longer term in a relative manner, okay? You could be a day trader, and it could be the high for the day. You could be a weekly trader or a monthly trader, and this could be that high.
