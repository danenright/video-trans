What we're going to look at again is this 2004 rate hike cycle. First to understand, rates fell, in other words long end rates actually fell in 2004 even with five consecutive rate hikes. So just imagine for the year of 2004 when the Fed had hiked five times in a row, on this trade or on the wrong side of this trade for almost 5 or 6 months. How would that have felt? How would it have felt to be an offside on an idea that you thought was absolutely flawless based on history? How would that have felt? Then, rates began to finally rise in Q1 of 2005. So after all that pain and torture, finally rates began to rise. However, how far did they rise? Well... Long-end rates continued high in 2005, but only rose above the highs made at the start of the hiking cycle in Q4 2005. In other words, had you taken on this trade when the Fed embarked on their hiking cycle, you wouldn't have even got back to the point where you entered the market. Imagine how painful that would have been. As you can see on the chart we have the blue line which depicts the 17 consecutive rate hikes or 25 basis point rate hikes from the Federal Reserve starting in 2004. The orange line is the US 5 year treasury bond yields. The red line is the US treasury 10 year yields. Now as we can see from the start of the hiking cycle had you initiated this trade for higher yields you would have almost instantly gone offside. You would have been losing money for for the first six months of this trade you would have been losing money. How would that have felt? How would you have explained that? Imagine you're a hedge fund. How would you explain that to your investors, that you're losing more and more money because based on history, yield should go up. How would that have felt? Can you see now why it's so important that we remain objective even when we have very strong subjective ideologies or ideas based on The purpose of me showing you this is I want you guys to understand that the principle is that it's good to have a little bit of subjective ideas, it's good to have intuition and experience based on the past. But first and foremost, always rely on objectivity. This market clearly showed us that yields were wanting to move lower, even when in theory they should have been moving higher. Therefore we shouldn't have been holding on to this trade. We should have accepted that something was not right. The market was giving us fact-based information that yields weren't going to rise, even though, subjectively, they should have.", "transcript": "Now I want to show you what happens when you allow subjectivity to be the most or the priority instead of objectivity.
