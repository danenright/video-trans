There are plenty of different inputs, but I'm only going to introduce you to three because they're extremely effective.

Now some of the other types of inputs that I have as a trader that you can consider as well is for example a routine analysis. So I constantly review my routine to make sure that the routine I have is most effective to my ultimate feedback loop. I then have potential rules or a rules-based approach. So what this simply means is I have certain rules that I follow, exact rules, so that when after I've made this decision, so long as I'm following these specific rules, they will ensure that I can measure the end decision or the end outcome based on did I follow Another one is to take away the good and the bad elements and recognize the good elements at the end of every day", "transcript": "just making decisions and executing, we're never able to really learn and give thought to the decisions we're making.

I think sometimes as traders, all we do at the end of the day is we write down what we did bad, we write down what we did good, but we don't ever learn and grow from them. So this is another kind of input that you could develop in your feedback loop. Now. Like I said how this whole process decision-making works. It's very simple. Okay. We've made a decision now The next process is to have an objective analysis, okay So once we've conducted a you know a an objective analysis, we then need to go and look at our process development Okay, so All that a process development is, is that we want to go and write down all the processes that we did over a period of time within, obviously before making the next decision, and we want to then go and analyze those processes. Now the reason is a lot of the time within those processes we have, there are what we In other words, we're making mistakes, but we don't even know that we're making those mistakes. So by having a process development, we can observe these mistakes. For instance, let's say in our objective analysis, we recognize there's trend in the market. Now, we can very clearly go at the end of the day and say, well, I was fading the market all day, even though objectively there was trend, therefore I was making So, we need to go correct that unconscious error. We need to put in place some form of a stop or some form of a rules-based approach or some form of a process so that we can ultimately turn that unconscious error into a conscious error or a conscious correction. So let's look at an example of what an unconscious error could look like. This example is something that probably many of you can relate to. It's impatience, not waiting for a trade strategy that you've learned and instead you just impulsively trade the market or you get sucked into trading what they call flow. The first thing to do is we have to create some form of a conscious correction. Now an example of a conscious correction would be for us to create a list of strategies on a trading sheet and before you execute, before you make a decision, you have to tick the strategy observed.

And it's that process that we've just created that effectively becomes the conscious correction. It's a thought, we've given thought to a correction. You don't just suddenly adopt this new process and become better. You have to ingrain it into your habits. So again, you probably have to adopt this process for at least 14 consecutive days in order to eventually make the marginal gain. So by adopting this new habit, eventually that conscious correction which you make where you tick the sheet, eventually that's going to become part of habit and it will then become an unconscious decision or an unconscious correction.

I'll say okay. Well. I came in this morning. There was obviously a little bit of news overnight about the UK But ultimately the flow is relatively slow. There was nothing really great going on There's no real correlations going on the equities were very good because of the many S&P But other than that there's not been a great deal that I would put into my sentiment overview Okay, if there was, if there was some risk off overnight because of the yen or because of China, then I'd put that in there. Okay, now the reason we do this is because when we can summarize sentiment and overview, what's going to start happening, if you summarize it every day, you're going to start to recognize certain patterns. So what do I mean by that? Let's say for all intents and purposes you go back to two weeks ago, three weeks ago, there was a period where we were actually seeing a lot of volatility in It was ranging within a 2% range, and as a result of that volatility, we were seeing volatility pass over into the European session. So how does that give us an opportunity? If you can recognize this volatility early on, and you start to recognize these patterns, you then come in with a very specific frame of mind, and it's that frame of mind that ultimately gives you that little bit of an edge. It doesn't guarantee success, it doesn't mean profit, but it gives you that little day-to-day sentiment overview. Okay, so that's where we start. We do a sentiment overview. Then, we go and list all the economic data. Why? Again, it's very simple. And I spoke about this, when did I speak about this? I have spoken about it at some point, but if you start to look at the economic data, every single piece, okay, what you're gonna recognize is that the markets are sensitive to certain economic data pieces. The markets sometimes open up or we get flows once a certain economic data piece is out of the way. And you're also going to notice when data pieces are no longer a valid edge to trade. So again, you do this because it helps you to develop an edge in and around when we have key economic data. Now any trader knows that over the course of a week, you're going to have every single week, at least at some point in the week, you're going to have some key economic So again, by templating it, you're going to know when a non-farm payrolls is trending the market. You're going to know when inflation is important. You're going to know when other data pieces are actually creating opportunities in and around the data.

I have spoken about it at some point, but if you start to look at the economic data, every single piece, okay, what you're gonna recognize is that the markets are sensitive to certain economic data pieces. The markets sometimes open up or we get flows once a certain economic data piece is out of the way. And you're also going to notice when data pieces are no longer a valid edge to trade. So again, you do this because it helps you to develop an edge in and around when we have key economic data. Now any trader knows that over the course of a week, you're going to have every single week, at least at some point in the week, you're going to have some key economic So again, by templating it, you're going to know when a non-farm payrolls is trending the market. You're going to know when inflation is important. You're going to know when other data pieces are actually creating opportunities in and around the data. We then move on, and again, I'm not going to go through this every single time. I want you to get the gist of it so we can get to the real nitty gritty of it.", "ocr_text": null, "visual_caption": null, "metadata": {"chunk_idx": 5}}

Because I'm creating a pause. I'm creating that within that feedback loop between when I traded today and when I come in again tomorrow, I want to create some sort of a pause along the way so that I can recognize certain pattern behaviors within my trading. Now the reason we list all the markets is because For me, I tend to find when I trade multiple markets in a day, i.e. anything more than four different markets, I tend to lose money. In other words, there's a high correlation between the more markets I trade to my P&L, okay? So more markets equals less P&L. Okay, and again, why? Well, because I'm only one human, and obviously I can only see so many things within a day. So the fact that I'm trading multiple markets means I'm probably fishing somewhere, just hoping to get a winner somewhere. Okay. So again that's why we list the markets. Then, and this is crucial, and again it's so important particularly in this closed feedback loop, you go and list every tradable opportunity. Now by tradable opportunities I don't mean the hindsight harry ones, I mean the I know this pattern, I've developed this pattern over the years, what were the patterns that were available for me Okay, not the ones that came up, not the comment that came out, okay. The ones that I recognized, bang, we had an outside day, I've known that pattern, I've journaled that pattern for three, four months. Okay, which trade opportunities came up today? Now again, why is that important, or where is that important in the feedback loop? Well, again, this is so important for the psychology, okay, because what a lot of traders do is they sometimes get into a frame of mind that the markets aren't offering opportunity. Now, by listing every single day the opportunities that come out, you're going to start to have a self-belief. It's a reinforcing principle that every single day there's at least one opportunity. If I told you what's the percentage of there being an opportunity every single day, if you are following this every single day okay and if you know that on average there's at least two tradable opportunities every single day you're not going to rush into the market you're not going to create certain patterns you're ultimately just going to wait for those tradable opportunities okay and that's what counts guys that's why we create this loop because let's say you didn't have this loop let let's remove this loop and see what it would look like if we didn't have this loop okay you would come in you wouldn't have lost the previous day, you come in, you're a little bit anxious, you're a little bit tight, you're not sure what to do, you're kinda just looking at the market, you're not sure if it's gonna give you something or not.", "transcript": "You're going to know when other data pieces are actually creating opportunities in and around the data.

You begin to spiral, you chase even more, and you just double down on your losses. pause in place, we are losing nothing, but we are only potentially gaining something which is confidence with our psychology. So again, this is why we create the pauses in the feedback loop. Then I'm going to go through these really quickly. So we then look at areas of focus. These are the areas within your own trading that you want to focus on. You take them apart. You start off with maybe your discipline. I was impulsive. There were three trades.

We create the pause we look at things Am I keeping it simple? Am I disciplined? Am I patient? Am I executing well? Am I averaging? Am I moving stops? Okay, you go through all these areas of focus you write them out and you write out an honest self-reflection Then we talk about achievements and this is again so crucial in the money in the feedback group Okay, because let's say we took a loss. Let's say we had a bad day I know one trade in mind who said to me yesterday had a really bad day wanting worst of the year And I said to most important in every single debrief firstly You have to do a debrief doesn't matter what the day is good or bad win or lose best or worst day You have to do some form of a debrief Okay, and within that debrief you always have to talk about achievements Why because that brings you back to the planet Earth?

I tend to look at goals So I say to myself if my goal is size accumulation All right, I want to make sure that the way to get better at size accumulation is with a tick box Okay, so I say to myself, well, if my goal is size accumulation, how am I going to get there? Well, it needs to be gradual, it needs to be deliberate, it needs to be rehearsed, it needs to be the daily goal I set out for myself.

Yeah straight away, which is that ie this trader has got certain correlations between the more markets he trades obviously his P&L will vary if he's very focused He'll perform better if he has a high level of commitment. He'll perform at a high performance Okay, and that is why we do a template because all of a sudden We've got this big little feedback loop and we're creating all these markers by which we can come and compare and learn to observe certain patterns about ourselves. And that is ultimately what the art of trading is about. It's about constantly recognizing how you're progressing, constantly ensuring that you're improving by creating every one of these pauses. Okay, that's all the pause is. It's within the feedback loop, ensuring we're allowing Now, if that doesn't convince you that this is the bloodline of trading, okay, let's look on the reverse side. I always like to play devil's advocate and say, let's say we remove all of these, okay? What are we going to gain from not doing a debrief, okay? We're going to gain a fat zero, maybe 45 minutes a day of our time that we feel is valuable, okay? Okay, you start to gain all sorts of wonderful things, confidence, trust, self-belief, understanding, you know, patience, skills, alright, and ultimately money. Okay, now, you then finish off a debrief with some goals, very very important, keep them simplistic and realistic. Okay again, the goals just pauses you. If yesterday you had a bad day, you didn't set yourself a goal today, well what are you trying to achieve? What are you striving towards today? Okay, and again, the mistake a lot of traders make, they want three or four goals. If I can give you one goal, it'll be set one goal every day. If that goal is just to get up the time that your alarm goes off so you can be in the office exactly at six o'clock in the morning, well, that's a very good goal to set yourself, okay? Also, remember, goals are not just a one-day thing. You don't set a one-day goal, okay? A goal tends to be at least a couple of days. I'd say, in general, it takes 21 days to form a very solid habit. So if you want to form a solid habit, you've got to set a goal for 21 days. Okay? Did I get up this morning on time? Yes, I did. Tomorrow, did I get up on time? Yes, I did. Did I get up on time? Yes, I did. Okay. Then we get to the nitty-gritty, and this is where it becomes very intricate. I'm not going to go into this in detail, but then you want to go through your strategy analysis.

Your tradable opportunities, you wrote them down. you now bring that tradeable opportunity into its metric form. What do we mean by that? Okay every trade strategy has got a set of characteristics and we go define those characteristics. Now I'm going to use the basic example of a flag because we all know flag it looks juicy it makes a lot of sense and la la la. Now what we need to do is within that pattern we need to recognize and observe that pattern within a number of metrics. Now again this is not a concise list, it's an example. So we want to observe that pattern through volume. We want to note what the volume is, high, low, relatively high, relatively low. Where does the volume come in? We then want to look at it in terms of time. How long does the pattern play time to play out? At what time of the day does it take to play out? What does the delta do? What is the cumulative delta do? And what is the relative changes? How does the market shift in terms of volatility, in terms of price response, in terms of price action? How does the interaction shift between buyers and sellers? And we go through and we ask ourselves this question and we answer. We say to ourselves, okay well within this breakout I observed there was extremely high volume and I write it out. And the same thing, I write out the time was this during this event. I look at the Delta and they're ready to change. Now write this all out, and again, why do we do this? Because guess what? You're always gonna get breakout trades in the markets. Okay, you had them last year, the year before, and you're gonna get them next year and the year after that, okay? So these characteristics, all we're doing is we're highlighting the key observations of a trade strategy, we're observing them, and ultimately, we're starting to build almost a... an understanding, an in-depth understanding of what creates a good breakout. So again, let's take a step back. Let's just say our feedback loop is here. Let's say today we took out a breakout trade in oil, okay? And we didn't go through all of this at the end of the day. We just thought, ah, I got it right. Bang, I nailed it. Awesome. Okay, and let's say there was one defining metric in there today. There was this really really high volume abnormally high Okay, I've I'd noted that you know over the last 20 of these breakouts It was abnormally high volume today was the highest I've ever seen and the breakout was incredible like 80 ticks But I don't go and log that information in my brain I don't go and physically think about it give it thought give it energy and log it in there for next time What happens tomorrow if the breakout comes and this time there's low volume? Okay, so we didn't do the analysis we come back tomorrow, but it's very low volume on this breakout", "transcript": "Yes, I did. Okay. Then we get to the nitty-gritty, and this is where it becomes very intricate. I'm not going to go into this in detail, but then you want to go through your strategy analysis. Alright? So, you take each pattern, as we observed up top, you take each strategy that you broke down. Okay? You wrote them down, yeah.

Okay, you had them last year, the year before, and you're gonna get them next year and the year after that, okay? So these characteristics, all we're doing is we're highlighting the key observations of a trade strategy, we're observing them, and ultimately, we're starting to build almost a... an understanding, an in-depth understanding of what creates a good breakout. So again, let's take a step back. Let's just say our feedback loop is here. Let's say today we took out a breakout trade in oil, okay? And we didn't go through all of this at the end of the day. We just thought, ah, I got it right. Bang, I nailed it. Awesome. Okay, and let's say there was one defining metric in there today. There was this really really high volume abnormally high Okay, I've I'd noted that you know over the last 20 of these breakouts It was abnormally high volume today was the highest I've ever seen and the breakout was incredible like 80 ticks But I don't go and log that information in my brain I don't go and physically think about it give it thought give it energy and log it in there for next time What happens tomorrow if the breakout comes and this time there's low volume? Okay, so we didn't do the analysis we come back tomorrow, but it's very low volume on this breakout", "ocr_text": null, "visual_caption": null, "metadata": {"chunk_idx": 10}}

Okay, so we didn't do the analysis we come back tomorrow, but it's very low volume on this breakout Guess what we're gonna do as as instinctive creatures. We're gonna come in and we're gonna trade that breakout exactly the same way Why because yesterday our bad habit got reinforced. We got rewarded. Okay, we executed. Well, we got paid very well today Something was different, but we still gonna execute the same way we did if not more aggressively and what's the outcome of that gonna be? Okay, we're gonna lose money now the profound part of that and this is the most most beautiful part Let's say you had done the analysis and you had recognized over time that when there's a low volume The probability of outcome goes from let's say 80% to like 30% Now it's not to say you wouldn't have taken the breakout of course you would have but you would never have taken it With the same kind of conviction as the previous day or with more size And that's the crux of it, it's that little piece of 45 minutes of time you spent just analyzing that gives you that little edge in decision making in the next opportunity. And that's the crux of templating, guys. It comes down to, in this feedback loop, ensuring that the feedback loop is not closed. Because when it is closed off, you are not growing, you're not progressing and you're not gaining anything. Okay, you do it in a form of a template. And again, templating is not just for trading. It is for every single industry that you can think of. They all have some form of templating so that they don't have a closed loop system.
