So reversal trade strategies. Let's define them. Firstly, what sort of timeframe players are you expecting to see in the reversal trade strategies? Again, you're going to see all timeframe participants. The reason is that, let's say for instance a market is moving lower. As this market is moving lower, we may have algorithmic, short-term and day traders As prices move lower and lower they could then run into both swing traders as well as longer term influential players. These longer term influential players turn the market back around in a very aggressive nature and as they do so both algorithmic and short term traders and day traders tend to exit those original short positions, buying the market higher up. In terms of initiative and responsive, we tend to see both initiative as well as responsive. Firstly, we see short-term day traders, as well as algorithmic, moving prices lower. They then run into longer timeframe responsive buyers. Those responsive buyers turn prices back around and then begin to initiate a move In terms of the time objective, reversal strategies can sometimes take a long time to reverse, but they can also take a short period of time. Again, it depends on the type of strategy you're trying to achieve. Make sure you interpret and understand what the time allocation is based on the strategy you are trying to create. In terms of volume and volatility, reversal strategies can show very very high volume and volatility as you will see in the examples I show you, but equally they can sometimes show a real lack of volume and volatility as momentum disappears. Again, make sure when you develop your strategies you interpret them accordingly. In terms of risk reward, reversal strategies can have very very high risk reward. you are technically still against the short-term trend, so it's imperative that you manage risk. Always remember, it doesn't matter how good a point of entry is, if you do not manage the risk, the markets can remain irrational for a lot longer than you think. Always manage risk, particularly when it comes to reversal pattern plays. Then when it comes to momentum, So what we're looking for is confirmation that a market has found some sort of a top or a bottom. Once it's done that, not only are we reducing risk, but we can then go with the momentum in the opposite direction.
