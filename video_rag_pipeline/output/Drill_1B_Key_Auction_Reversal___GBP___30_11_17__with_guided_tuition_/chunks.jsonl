Now this is obviously the key auction reversal strategy. Before we get straight into it, bear in mind we spoke of two variations. One of the variations was where we had either a V or inverse symmetrical reversal and the second was where we have an outside candle coming off of the top of the session. We obviously spoke about the two variations in a sense of what they mean and the implications thereof. In essence they do both form very, very strong highs and lows in the market. It's just simply how quickly, in other words time is the basic difference between the two variations of the strategy. The example we're looking at won't be the symmetry based strategy. We obviously did deal with that in the unit session so you can watch that replay back. This is simply an outside candle. So let's pay attention closely to this current rotation. We can see obviously it opened relatively close to the low. The market's gone but quite aggressively left quite a strong low volume area, also Note now what we're going to talk about in terms of the strategy. Bear in mind, when we get that rejection or that reversal... whether it's either one of the variations, we always want to see a lot of volume and a lot of initiative. It's an initiative, initiative price response trade strategy. So what we can see now is initially we've got that initiative, the market's moved quite aggressively higher. We know it's initiative for a number of reasons. One, we can see the relative pick up in volume as well as price, so we can see prices over which we're auctioning. We've obviously got the imbalance in the middle, as well as now this auction higher up. So we can see that initiative coming into the market. It then runs into a block of offer, so it runs into a real big liquidity. bucket that's sitting just above the recent highs. And straight away as soon as the market identifies that it's run into that bucket and it's extended upon the morning's highs, we see the sellers step in quite aggressively, quite intentionally. So note initially the market went bid. We saw quite a lot of buying above those 35.50s. Once we got above those 35.50s, note now how we're only seeing selling into the market. We've now re-entered that imbalance, and we can see the market beginning the process of filling out the imbalance now. Again, what is lovely about this trade strategy is we don't have to rush in, we don't have to be preemptive, we don't have to guess.", "transcript": "So welcome then to unit 12 strategy 7 drill session.

Once we get the weak close and the outside candle close here, we simply want to wait for that little pull back, wait for the market to bounce, and when we see that absorption we do want to bounce. Now I just want to go back a couple of frames and note something. So note as we've come down here, note where those secondary buyers are. We spoke in terms of this trade strategy of the three key responses. The initial initiative drive we've mentioned. We then run into responsive sellers providing liquidity, which we noted from 35.50 up to 35.55. Once the market goes offered on initiative, we then find those secondary buyers, which And the key was that this secondary bit of buy side response, once we get below that, we should see the initiative continue and that's exactly what we're getting. We're getting this initiative continue lower. Now in terms of trade strategy, we spoke about execution point and that is exactly where we want to execute. We want to execute at that point where we had that secondary buying. Let's pay attention to this, I'm just going to move this on a little bit so we can get to that point where we do see the retest and see how it responds. Okay, so we can see the market goes back but now a little bit of absorption on the low, a little bit of thinning out, and straight away it trades into that secondary response area that we saw at 44.43. So the moment we saw that lack of wanting to initiate above that error, we've got to be quite aggressive. Note the absorption in front of it now, 42 is trading 118 lots, a little bit up at 43, 35 trade, 39 trade, 45 trade, 55 trade, 68 trade, okay, and bang, we're now filled at that price that we want to be filled at, which is ultimately the secondary response down. Now, in terms of stop, it's very simple. We do not want to be trading back inside this bucket positioning. What I did say, however, is you can be a little bit... more open with the stop simply because you're going to get some very significant reward when we continue the initiation in the opposite direction. So just do bear that in mind. Don't keep a stop too tight.

So let's have a look Now note we said we want to see initiative once we get below ultimately that lower end of that candle. So if we get below those 29s, below that 16x0, we want to see the market begin the process of initiation lower. Now one thing to factor in, the delta on the day is positive 1500 still. That does, you know, we should factor that in because it does mean that if we do we can obviously unwind the remainder of that Delta. So there really are a lot of factors in our favor within this current play of the key auction reversal.

I'm just going to fast-forward this along. A little bit of absorption coming in the low. No real aggressive second leg of initiative just yet. Again, we see the market come up, and again we see the market stop and test at that point. previous area where the sellers now got stuck in. So initially we had buyers responding on the first pullback. Now that area where sellers responded, i.e. any kind of aggressive buying being absorbed, we've seen the market now stop and pause at this area. We can really see the market responding and respecting these price points, and the important thing to understand is obviously, note the lack of symmetry, I think that's the real key here. It doesn't look as pretty as say a V or inverse V reversal, but ultimately the principle underlying the trade strategy is exactly the same. Okay guys, in terms of then the target, well like we said, we're looking for that unwind of the delta, or at least the initiative second, the initiative leg lower. You won't see it within this video, it does come, you can go and view that on the 30th of November 2017. In terms of the stop, obviously we always want to be trailing.
