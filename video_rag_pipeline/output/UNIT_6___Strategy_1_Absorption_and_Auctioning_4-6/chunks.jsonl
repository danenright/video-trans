Because consolidation as we mentioned in the principle section tends to be relatively low volume. Okay so what we're actually going to be talking about is the process of accumulation and distribution. Okay now we know to the key difference between accumulation and distribution and consolidation was very simply the volume and the delta exchange. In other words In accumulation and distribution, we do tend to see a much higher relative amount of volume being traded versus the consolidation. Now, the key identifier of this trade strategy comes at the extreme pivots, okay, and what you're going to tend to see is you're going to tend to see some real dark high-volume areas, high-volume areas, and then effectively some real dark high-volume areas and high-volume areas. of high volume areas at the extreme points of the pivot. Now note obviously in terms of the auction process what we're seeing here is no real strength in the auction process rather just responsive price action at the high and then responsive price action at the lower K. Once it finally breaks in either direction we then get the process of initiative. Now note obviously when we do get this initiative response and the stronger auctioning process It's usually going to be accompanied by some Some auction imbalances Okay, so very typically once the break comes obviously you're going to get these auction imbalances Accompanying it and the reason being is very simple Now, if we look at what's effectively happened with the delta and the volume, whilst we are sitting inside this accumulation and distribution zone, in essence what we're doing is we're building up a position within this tight range.

However, you can see this in balanced conditions as well It's not to say it doesn't work equally well But for me, I've noticed that in imbalanced conditions the absorption and auctioning trade strategy works far more effectively let's have a look at some examples now so obviously this is taken from the 16th of December it's the euro dollar do note this is a rotational based you know candle or footprint chart now as we go through every example I'm going to show you you know both time based and rotational based so that you get used to you know seeing them with different views now Obviously, what we can see is the absorption auctioning, it can work particularly well on a rotation assuming that your rotations are set to the right rotation.

Obviously, as we go through these strategies, guys, none of these will be taken outside of cash showers for good reason. Like I mentioned, most of the strategies are applicable when there is interaction between buyers and sellers. Now, we noted that that interaction is best seen when the cash market is in. These time formats won't be quite correct, but in essence, what we've seen... the market has gone into a sideways holding we can obviously see a nice pivot on the downside and a nice pivot to the upside. Now note we can see some real extreme absorption at the high and then again equally some absorption at the low, some absorption at the low. Once that resolves itself again note as well whilst we in this zone of accumulation and distribution note the high volume, relatively high compared to what you've seen. Also note the delta. So note how the delta goes positive on the upward rotation and then high volume and the delta goes negative on the downward rotation. This is a function of absorption and auctioning. You are going to see this within these rotations. But the important thing to note is once we break we want to see initiative.

Okay, so as you can see here, we can see relatively lighter colors here and relatively light colors before then running into darker colors once we start to see liquidity being found. That's what you can think of the darker colors as, it's simply just liquidity being provided. So once we get the initiative, it will look like a lighter color until it runs into some responsive sellers in this example which will start to make the Delta colors a little Okay, do note, obviously, well, like we said, we want to also see with any kind of initiative, we always want to see the volume pick up, but we also want to see the Delta go in the direction. That's so crucial with initiative price action. You always want to see both the volume and the Delta go in the direction of the initiative. Now note in terms of color lines, like we always say, once we get that initiative being taken, we will obviously post a nice turquoise color. In terms of entry point now, what I am going to say is do note, you know, I think one of the mistakes that a lot of traders will make with any strategy is they want an exact execution. They want an exact entry, an exact exit, okay? It doesn't work like that. All right, the important thing to understand is that every one of these is a strategy, but in essence what we're looking for is we're looking to be long once the If I can remove this, you'll see quite a lot of absorption taking place in the zone around these 75 to 77 area. Some real good absorption, that's your entry point on the break. Why? Because what happens is we initially see some responsive buying here and responsive selling and what happens is that responsive selling or that pivot resistance then becomes Okay, now note the two variations with regard to the break up or down. Like I said, you can see some very aggressive initiative where we do tend to have imbalances or as in this example you can see that we have a relatively slow gradual move to the upside. Okay, now that's important to know because you know it's not always going to be as straightforward and clean as you know some of the examples you might see in some of the later slides. Now the next example Again is one of the failed reversals now and I'm going to show you this this failed reversal and show you what it looks like. So again this is taken from the the E-Mini S&P 500 quite recent as well. Now again what I want to show you", "transcript": "within these rotations. But the important thing to note is once we break we want to see initiative. Now note initiative in terms of the delta And the colors you can expect to see is that you're going to get the initiative. The initial part will be light colors. Okay, so as you can see here, we can see relatively lighter colors here and relatively light colors before then running into darker colors once we start to see liquidity being found. That's what you can think of the darker colors as, it's simply just liquidity being provided. So once we get the initiative, it will look like a lighter color until it runs into some responsive sellers in this example which will start to make the Delta colors a little Okay, do note, obviously, well, like we said, we want to also see with any kind of initiative, we always want to see the volume pick up, but we also want to see the Delta go in the direction. That's so crucial with initiative price action. You always want to see both the volume and the Delta go in the direction of the initiative. Now note in terms of color lines, like we always say, once we get that initiative being taken, we will obviously post a nice turquoise color. In terms of entry point now, what I am going to say is do note, you know, I think one of the mistakes that a lot of traders will make with any strategy is they want an exact execution. They want an exact entry, an exact exit, okay? It doesn't work like that. All right, the important thing to understand is that every one of these is a strategy, but in essence what we're looking for is we're looking to be long once the If I can remove this, you'll see quite a lot of absorption taking place in the zone around these 75 to 77 area. Some real good absorption, that's your entry point on the break. Why? Because what happens is we initially see some responsive buying here and responsive selling and what happens is that responsive selling or that pivot resistance then becomes Okay, now note the two variations with regard to the break up or down.

Now again what I want to show you is this market enters a phase of consolidation, we can see real sort of extreme kind of volume, negative delta taking place. We then see a flip of that, the market then absorbs on the higher up prices and then it initiates and this is quite interesting because we then get the initiative taken to the upside and we notice that because of the volume as well. We see, obviously before that, we did see quite an aggressive amount of responsive selling in the market. It got overwhelmed, the market extends to the upside, but very quickly reverses and finds itself back inside the initial range. What then occurs, the market retests, note, and this is the key to the reversal strategy, the market then retests that original absorption area So that's what we call a high pocket volume or a high volume area. That was where the passive selling was occurring. So the market re-enters that zone, it re-tests and again absorbs another 1600 contracts before then beginning the aggressive reversal. So like I said, the reversal trade strategy, what tends to occur is once we fail to break, Very quickly move from one side of the range to the other side of the range and what you can see is that market within the same rotation Takes, you know almost within a couple of minutes Reverses straight to the other side. So that's a key factor of the reversal strategy So again, if you're going to learn the strategy remember first and foremost, we're looking for the break Obviously, you need to manage your stop quite effectively. As I said in the previous example, you know if we go back to that quickly, very simply Ideally, we don't really want to see, I mean we can see the market gave us a nice imbalance, but ideally we don't want to see the market re-enter this range. So again, in terms of a stop, if you're someone that keeps it very, very tight, you might have had only a couple of ticks stop. For me, I didn't want to see this imbalance be taken up, why? the start of initiative. So for me a stop would have gone right over there.

Now note the volume being traded here Do we have extreme delta on the extremes? The simple answer is no. This happens to be the euro dollar again, but no real extreme.

Now the reason I want to include this was very simple, okay, a lot of you will look at that and say well it's a perfect example, it broke, extended, left all sorts of imbalances, had a high volume and a shift in the delta, so in essence it still did the same thing. Remember, this job is about reducing or increasing the probability of success, and that's why the conditioning is crucial.

This time, however, we have a seller selling into a really aggressive buyer. In other words, we've got a really aggressive buyer reloading at very extreme prices and that was our clue, that was our subtle clue, a lot like the clue we saw in the previous rotation.

Okay retests that break point before then Extending on higher, and I'm just going to fast forward this so we can see the process of one time framing So note obviously we've got the break note the market did come back a second time give you an entry point Before then continuing higher Okay, obviously you've got this video to go over yourself in your own time, but I just wanted to highlight that really key, you know, nuance shifting the price action.

Again, you can see we've come down now, the market's beginning the process of accumulation and distribution. So we can see accumulation at the low, and then we distribute at the high, and then accumulation from the sellers, and then we distribute at the low, and this process continues for some time now. What you'll recognize is that obviously we can see quite a negative cumulative delta on the day But we can see again every time the price has come down. We see the Delta Becoming more negative as the responsive buyers are happy to be filled there and provide liquidity Equally once we go pit we can see obviously the responsive sellers happy to provide liquidity and get filled now Let's move on to the break point because remember as I said in terms of variations You always assume that the break will continue with initiative. Okay, you never assume it will reverse So I'm going to show you exactly how you execute the reversal now. Okay, so we can see again more negative Delta and Let's see if we can find that little bit of a a telltale sign as I said the calm before the storm now note Okay, we can see obviously market thinning out a little bit. Notice now in terms of, look at the accumulation that we were receiving at this price 66.1. So we're receiving dark colors here once and twice. All of a sudden the market's beginning to happily facilitate trade again in this area. Okay so what we can see again and this is such a telltale sign. Notice how previously we would see buyers absorbing the market and buyers reloading and providing liquidity. Now I have a look what the sellers Okay, look where the sellers are providing liquidity and where they're absorbing. So this was very, very similar to the previous example. You tend to get this just before the breakout and there's your clue, there's your tip when you get the absorption coming in from the sellers at a lower down prices, that's your clue we're about to break. Now let's see what this break looks like and let's follow it on the reversal. Now remember what I said in terms of breakout? and we want to see some some imbalances so what we can see here is we broke below okay we've seen the seller's position for the break we've broken below and what have we seen straight below that okay some really really aggressive buying okay that was effectively a real big clue of the reversal obviously okay we won't this is a little bit more of a tricky example because it didn't quite extend as we can see on the candlestick it didn't quite extend by that far but we can see once obviously it did go bid and that initiative came in. Notice the imbalances,", "transcript": "How do we know? Well, look at the extremes. We have a high delta. Look at the extremes. We have a negative delta. We have some really dark colors at the extreme sides of both pivots. Now what I want to point out is once this market retraces back into the distribution zone, what then finally occurs? Again, you can see we've come down now, the market's beginning the process of accumulation and distribution. So we can see accumulation at the low, and then we distribute at the high, and then accumulation from the sellers, and then we distribute at the low, and this process continues for some time now. What you'll recognize is that obviously we can see quite a negative cumulative delta on the day But we can see again every time the price has come down.
