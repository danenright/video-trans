One, we've got one-time framing, so if you look at the candlesticks, you can see that 8, 9 one time frame candles where we do not make a higher high but every single day we're making a lower low. So what we're seeing here is almost a one time framing initiative being taken from sellers. Now again, what happens is, remember what we spoke about in module 2 when we spoke about one time framing? This will occur until the initiative move from sellers runs into responsive buyers. As you can see, once we run into those responsive buyers, we get quite a nice bounce until the market finds those responsive sellers that then enter fresh shorts. Now, interesting with this composite profile, as you can see on the right of the chart, you can see how the market almost forms a double distribution, where we have one set of prices being accepted, the market then moves lower again and then begins to accept a lower set of prices. Composite profile now will help me develop a potential understanding and idea of what this market may do going forward, which is potentially fill out the double distribution if it cannot hold the low volume area. I hope you guys are starting to see now how some of the strategies and principles we spoke about in module 1 and 2 are starting to filter through even into composite profiling.", "transcript": "So the next example we're going to look at now is a couple of days, and the reason I've illustrated this example is twofold.
