Now again, remember that concept of price, time and volume. Price advertises the opportunity, time regulates each opportunity and measures the degree of confidence, and volume measures the degree of success of each auction. I'm sure by now you know that definition very well as we have discussed it throughout But the basic premise remains the same. Every single volume profile consists of volume, price and time and that's why it's paramount we keep repeating this. More important is the degree of success unlocks vital information about future price movements. In other words, volume that measures the degree of success, it's important we assess this degree of success as that will tell us potentially So what do we mean by that? Let's take a basic example. If for instance a new comment comes out or a new piece of information hits the market and we see a very big surge in volume as well as price direction, that is telling us something very vital which is that the market feels this new information is particularly important. Had we seen this type of move on relatively lower volume, that could suggest to us a number of other factors such as a potential squeeze or liquidation, or maybe just a very uncertain market as to what was occurring. Then perhaps the most important skill you must master to become a successful trader Remember guys, it's all well and good looking at a chart, looking at where price is trading, but you need to be able to understand where price is trading relative to something, where volume is relative to previous volume, where the market has come from relative to where it has been. So understanding these elements in its own is not that powerful, but understanding So let's look at some of the key volume metrics you will be exposed to in volume profiles and which you can develop various strategies on. Firstly, the volume point of control. Remember this is the point or the price at which the most volume has been traded over a period of day. relative to other days or relative to other prices, or are there a number of prices that could have been the volume point of control? Where is the volume point of control situated? In value, out of value, high of the day, low of the day. Then, volume profile at price as a percentage of the day's volume. So again, how much volume is at each price relative to 90% or 80% of the day's volume is transacted in the low bound of the day, that's telling", "transcript": "We're now going to discuss volume as a market identifier of trade facilitation.
