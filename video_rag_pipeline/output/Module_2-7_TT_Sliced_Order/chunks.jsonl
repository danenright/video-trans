The TT time-sliced order slices a large order quantity into smaller disclosed orders and sends each into the market at fixed time intervals, which can be defined as the number of minutes, seconds, or milliseconds. It can also be configured to begin placing orders at a specific time, as well as once a chosen price level is traded. If we'd like to buy 50 S&P futures contracts without disclosing our full order quantity at to help minimize our impact on the market. We select TT Time Sliced from the Order Type drop-down menu. We'll have the time-sliced algos submit a limit order into the market every three seconds and display five contracts at a time. We want these limit orders to join the bids, so we will set an offset of zero from the bid. We can customize the behavior of orders still working in the market when the next order is submitted by defining a leftover action, should the previous five-lot order not be filled at the end of the time increment. we will set the leftover action to pay up and set a number of pay up ticks to one. This will adjust the price of the previous working child order by one tick. With TT time sliced, we can have our algo begin submitting child orders on a specific event by checking trigger. Let's configure our algo to trigger once our last traded price reaches 2079.50 by setting our trigger to if touched and set a trigger price of 2079.50. This will hold the algo on the TT server until the market trades at that price. and then TT will automatically begin working the algo and submit the first child order into the market. We place our 50 lot order and can see the parent order in the order book and audit trail with our trigger price at 2079.50. Once the market trades at our trigger price, TT begins working our algo and starts joining the bid with a five lot order every three seconds. We can see that when one of the order does not fill at 2079.25, it is paid up one tick to 2079.50. The subsequent order then joins the bid also at $20.79.50. The TT Time Sliced ALGO continues to submit orders until the whole 50-lot order is filled. As you can see, breaking your larger order into smaller quantities with TT Time Sliced gives you the flexibility to time the submission of these orders by minutes, seconds, or milliseconds to trigger your order once a specific price is traded and customize the behavior of child orders.
