Now, the wonderful thing about leverage is, It's it's a term that not many people talk about people are afraid to talk about leverage Why because look at every advert you see on the CNBC the Bloomberg's the you know these these spread betters all of them talk about you know risk of loss being more than your initial capital and you know leverage is Bad, and you know if you use leverage effectively, you know you effectively risking 20 30 percent of your count on any given trade so What's been advertised out there is that leverage is a bad thing. Now, yes, in terms of the basic essence of portfolio management and making real returns over time, yes, leverage is a dangerous product, but only if you don't understand leverage.

How do you work out those odds all right? It's not a case of I have you know 10,000 samples of a specific trade set up And I suddenly say well the likelihood of the outcome being favorable is 62 and a half percent It doesn't work like that okay the outcomes are based on various patterns that we develop over time based on various You know intuitive price actions. We see on the ladder over period of time and it's that intuition that feeling that confidence that trust all of that together equals a probability of an outcome okay so just bear with me when I use that word probability it's not in the most technical sense it's not in the sense of you know I back tested a thousand sample sets it doesn't work like that okay that's the game left for the algorithms the statisticians and you know the big macro hedge funds that choose to create these algos okay so Leverage in in the sense of the word now What I want to talk about in terms of the leverage is obviously the pros, okay?", "transcript": "The footprint course, unit 15, risk event trading.

Yes, you can scale up you can make a lot more money. Yes, you know you can make Better returns over the long run. Okay, the important thing when it comes to leverage is to not just understand the positives about it, it's to understand the psychology behind leverage, or the cons, okay? So when I talk about this, you'll very often, if you spend a lot of time with me, I always ask myself, I put myself in a situation of, if there was something or a situation I hadn't been in before, what would the psychological implications of that be? Okay, let's use an example. So let's say for instance, in a futures market I'm used to using a one lot. Okay, now over a period of time and over a number of trade setups and trade strategies, I'm going to get used to my risk being within a specific range. So let's say I'm used to my risk being between minus 100 and say minus 200 on average over a given period of time. Okay, now all of a sudden I decide I'm going to leverage up and I'm going to go to a four lot. Okay, so I'm taking on four times the multiple. This parameter of a hundred to two hundred is going to move from four hundred to eight hundred Okay, so straight away You can see the psychological impact of being used to being in that sort of a range of a risk and now you've moved to Almost a complete outlier of a risk something that makes you feel completely uncomfortable There's going to be a psychological impact. Now it's important to understand that psychological impact because what I found very early in my career was I really battled with increasing the size because I wasn't willing to accept that natural progression in my risk. All right, so if you can understand and accept that by the very nature of taking on more risk, your downside's equally going to have to look a little bit different and feel a bit different. By accepting that in the beginning, from up front, you're going to be able to learn to leverage up a lot easier. Okay, remember guys, you have to take the downside with the potential upside. That's how it works. Ultimately, what it comes down to is regardless of how much shi is using, how much levering. It all comes back to the same process, okay. Whether you're taking on, let's get an example here. So whether you're taking on, let's say, a breakout trade, okay, whether you're taking that on with a one lot or a four lot is completely irrelevant, right. There is no change to the process. Why? Because the market will take you on a one lot or a four lot.

It's just understanding the psychology behind what it means to actually leverage up. Okay, now important, a lot of you are going to say, yes, but when is the right time to use leverage? Or my account can't necessarily handle the leverage. Yes, that is a fact, okay? It's something I had to accept. So earlier in my career, let's say I had a, and you know I want to now progress to maybe a five or a six or an eight lot now of course yes I have to accept that I might lose say one and a half thousand pounds okay that's a significant amount of my count all right so what we would typically do as traders and again what I want you to take away from today is I want to encourage you guys to learn a little bit about leverage through understanding it okay now one of the things we used to do a lot if I have a good day so let's say I make a thousand euros today whatever my count goes to six thousand then I'm going to move my clip up or I'm going to leverage up by a marginal amount so I'm going to go from trading say a five lot to a six lot that day and then if I had another green day say to 6400 I would then say okay I'm going to push it to a seven lot and slowly but surely I got used to the fact that you know psychologically I was taking on more risk But I was doing it, note, I was doing it in a positive run. The biggest mistake new traders make, I made, most traders make when it comes to leverage is they tend to use leverage. when they're wrong, when they're offside, when they've lost control of a trade. And that's why that psychological damage sits with them for the rest of their careers, because they always seem to associate that blowout, you know, in their account, or that blowout moment to leverage, okay? It's got nothing to do with that, right? It was the wrong use of leverage that created that. Okay, so if you've had that moment, if you've had that experience, try and associate. Learn to use leverage when you're on a good run and do it incrementally. You take those two tips of advice, guys, and you're going to finally start understanding the use of leverage. Okay, so let's come back to that old question, and this is where we're going to wrap up on leverage. Where do professional traders use leverage? Okay, well, it's very simple. Let's say we take, for example, you know, a lot of you guys follow us on the morning streams and we can talk about, we're going to talk two examples, okay? Now let's take the Bund example for this morning, alright? Someone asked about the Bund, the question was there, what was it that gave us the inclination that the Bund was going to go lower, okay?", "transcript": "a breakout trade, okay, whether you're taking that on with a one lot or a four lot is completely irrelevant, right.

Well there just happened to be a wedge. Now I'm actually going to get that up for you so that we can actually just look Alright, so there's the wedge. You can see it nice and pretty on your screens. We've been sort of sitting in this wedge for the last couple of days, almost a week now, and okay, we can see that all of a sudden this morning we came and we tested that wedge outside of the cash house. Okay, so now we have a trade setup. We have an opportunity. The market is showing us a technical pattern and we would like to take advantage of this pattern. Now that in its own and now I want you guys to just I want to almost bring you inside my mind Okay, that in its own does not necessarily imply. I'm going to use leverage. Okay, so What happened in this situation was the market broke it filtered down. We got a very big pickup in the volume Okay, so where would we use leverage in this example? All right some traders and what I'm going to need to do now is I'm going to need to zoom you in onto an even shorter term time frame, so I'm just going to bring up the I was hoping to bring up the one minute chart, but if you go back and you look at this, once we took out that initial balance low, so I'm going to draw it over here. Once we took out the initial balance low, after the cash opened, the market then sat for almost 20 minutes churning sideways. down below the key base trend line or support line or whatever you want to call it, once we're broken below that and started to accumulate, that is when traders employed their leverage. That is when traders got involved. Why? And this is the clue. The art to leverage, guys, the art to trading is knowing the risk. Okay, the minute you know the risk on any trade, it doesn't matter what you want to call it. The minute you know that risk, you have got a very powerful trade. Okay, so. The risk in this trade is very simple, right above that initial balance low, which coincided with that break of that support. That is where the trade was invalid, that is where the trade was gone and no longer worth being in. So as long as we were below the break and accumulating sideways, traders were then leveraging up, getting stuck in that sideways range and once it then finally took up the bottom end of that downward range, we got the aggressive 10, 15 tick down move. That was the play from this morning. That was how we incorporated leverage. Okay, now let's say for all intents and purposes, let's say it didn't go down in the manner that it did. So let's say it did this instead.

Because when you employ leverage, one, you are taking on more risk, so you need more confidence, you need more understanding of the trade you're going to take on. So when there are less variables to lean on, when there's less information to lean on, when there's less probability of an outcome occurring, that is when you don't Okay, it comes back to that whole question of when do we use leverage?

That's our Bund example for this morning, I hope you guys understood now, not just how we got into it, why we got into it, how we would have executed, where the stop was, where the target was, okay, again, that's a very personal thing, I never talk about targets because what is the point about talking about a target? One person might feel that he wants to take five ticks because he knows there's a 90% chance of that happening. Some trader might prefer to have a smaller size and run it for a bigger target. What is in the personal thing is one why we enter and to where the risk is okay The risk is known the minute you know the risk in a trade. You've got a trade now The last thing I'm going to say with leverage.

So make sure when you're developing your strategy, develop your strategy based on, you know, ultimately what your count is. Do you wanna use leverage? Do you not wanna use leverage?

This is strategy number 10. This is the risk event trading section. Do note, these are counter trend strategies and momentum strategies in effect. And ultimately you will require a bit of context. I'll share some of that context with you within the strategy session. And note, you will sometimes need quite aggressive execution methodologies but again in the strategy section. So you should notice, as you are all now professional pattern recognition experts, that every single one of the principles has been highlighted. The reason is simple. For a risk event trading, obviously things speed up. Everything moves at a far greater speed. Now within that movement, volatility effectively implies potential for opportunity. Because of that potential for opportunity you're going to need to be switched on to every one of these principles We've first introduced in unit three, but what we've consistently gone over throughout units six to fifteen So again, we are going to cover some really key principles here every one of them In essence will be key in one of the three patterns.

The reason is that risk event trading, the art of risk event, is in the word. It's in the event that an unlikely risk, or it's in the unlikely event that an event occurs in which positions are now at risk. That's in essence what risk event trading. In other words, risk event is nothing more other than outliers. Some people call them black swans some people call them outliers some people call them whatever they want okay but in essence it's where the markets are not correctly pricing the potential for that risk to occur now again i must note that obviously the concept of a black swan event is a very rare occurrence okay so it's almost a form of an extreme outlier right now how it works Very simply, I'm going to explain it to you with a scale and I'm going to move on to the next slide to show you this So if I was to illustrate How risk event trading effectively works it all comes down to a scale right now The higher the level of the risk so the higher the risk the higher or the greater the scope is for opportunity and that's pretty much a great summary of risk event trading so as we go through this Just always keep this in the back of your mind. The higher the risk, or the bigger the outlier, or the less that a potential risk is priced by the market, the greater the opportunity is for you as a trader.

We allocate capital And this is a great rule of thumb. This is something I firmly believe in when it comes to wanting to learn the real skill of employing leverage. So you take your account, let's say it's a $10,000 account, and you say to yourself, well, on a day-to-day basis, I need to give myself at least 20 days, 20 blowout days, okay? That's, if you're a consistent trader, you shouldn't need more than 20 blowout days. And you say to yourself, by that definition, okay, or $500 to today and what you do is you come into the market you recognize a trade that is an 85 probability and you say to yourself I've got a three tick stop so the tick increment let's say is $30 therefore I can take five times 30 and I buy 15 lots and what will be will be whether I lose 500 or make 500 that's not important most important lesson you will learn from adopting this process is why and how leveraging can be so immensely helpful in your career and get you onto that next level of your learning curve. Okay, so please understand that leverage is not something traders use every single day. Okay, they utilize it when and only when the odds of an outcome are stacked in their So that's the real art to leverage. Hopefully you understand that now. Don't be afraid to employ that. Give it a crack. It definitely did help me a lot in my career. Now let's talk a little bit about the three types of patterns you're going to see in risk event training. Okay so there's three patterns typically you'll see. Whenever you have risk events these are the three patterns you're going to see now. The first is obviously what we call a trend trend. So the risk event occurs again. Notice these risk events can be a central bank, okay can be economic data again key economic data and even a market release okay so something like earnings release or surprise earning release so something that surprises the market the market wasn't expecting okay now in this instance the market can respond in three unique ways the first", "transcript": "Okay, why?

How this looks, market has the initial rally, quite aggressive, a lot of single prints, a lot of untraded area, illiquid, liquidity at a premium, very shallow pullback, hardly a response, more a little bit of profit taking from the algorithms, not really a response of sellers before an extension and a secondary trend higher. That's the first pattern we can observe and we will look at an example of that the live examples. The second is again is called an initiative consolidation. So we get the initiative looks a little bit different to the first leg in example one in a sense that there's more liquidity on the way up. Okay so this is the nuance in the first example there's very little liquidity so low liquidity. Okay the second example there's more liquidity so the market So response of sellers backs off and we begin the process of just distributing. But we hold effectively the initiative. In this case, obviously the market can extend or it can drop lower, but in general this market is going to hold a bit for a lot longer than it's going to hold the offer. So again, a little bit more of a bias in terms of price towards the upside. The third is very simple. The fundamental hits or the risk event hits and the market reverses the entire thing and continues lower. And again we are going to look at an example of this. Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to come back to that initial example where we're talking about the bigger the risk event or the bigger the outlier, the greater the opportunity. Now straight away you should all be looking at this and you should be saying to yourself in the first example if the market's going to trend trend, that's a very unique opportunity.

In the second example again there is a definite edge here however in this example you might want to be aggressive initially Take some profits allow the market to come back and try again. So the second example, okay the opportunity Is still there. So an opportunity still exists, but it's slightly less than the first example. Okay Equally the winners are Smaller. Okay, the third example Again, this is one where you have to be very cautious so in this example the market extends initiates one way and then initiates in the opposite direction Now again, you would have noticed in the previous unit, we did speak about a line in the sand. Obviously with every single risk event, central bank, economic data, market releases, we always put a line in the sand. Because if we do get back below that red line on the same trading session, we will always get an unwind of the bias or a flush out of the delta positioning. So in the third example, we can see that opportunity, okay I don't want to say it's Okay, so this is what we would call typically a trader's market, so you have to really pay attention to every one of the principles you've learned to ultimately execute successfully in this third example. Now, the difference between every one of these three trade strategies is simply just the degree of outlier. It's the degree of black swan. Okay, so what do you mean by that? In other words, the less priced the market is for the information that it's received, If it's already expected and priced and the market was anticipating it, it's going to move most likely like pattern number three. That's the key crux to it. The crux is to go and trade a number of data pieces, trade a number of central bank releases, economic releases, and learn to identify when these three patterns in play. Obviously, the tension we want to give and the energy and the focus is on the pattern However, that being said, we can still take advantage of the opportunity in the second and third pattern, but we need to learn to identify very unique approaches to trading those. So let's go through those approaches now, and I'm going to show you where we'd execute on all three of the trade patterns.

In the second example again there is a definite edge here however in this example you might want to be aggressive initially Take some profits allow the market to come back and try again. So the second example, okay the opportunity Is still there. So an opportunity still exists, but it's slightly less than the first example. Okay Equally the winners are Smaller. Okay, the third example Again, this is one where you have to be very cautious so in this example the market extends initiates one way and then initiates in the opposite direction Now again, you would have noticed in the previous unit, we did speak about a line in the sand. Obviously with every single risk event, central bank, economic data, market releases, we always put a line in the sand. Because if we do get back below that red line on the same trading session, we will always get an unwind of the bias or a flush out of the delta positioning. So in the third example, we can see that opportunity, okay I don't want to say it's Okay, so this is what we would call typically a trader's market, so you have to really pay attention to every one of the principles you've learned to ultimately execute successfully in this third example. Now, the difference between every one of these three trade strategies is simply just the degree of outlier. It's the degree of black swan. Okay, so what do you mean by that? In other words, the less priced the market is for the information that it's received, If it's already expected and priced and the market was anticipating it, it's going to move most likely like pattern number three. That's the key crux to it. The crux is to go and trade a number of data pieces, trade a number of central bank releases, economic releases, and learn to identify when these three patterns in play. Obviously, the tension we want to give and the energy and the focus is on the pattern However, that being said, we can still take advantage of the opportunity in the second and third pattern, but we need to learn to identify very unique approaches to trading those. So let's go through those approaches now, and I'm going to show you where we'd execute on all three of the trade patterns.

Now before we look at the execution methodology Let's just go over one or two other principles to understand. Why does news or central bank news or market releases, why does it bring volatility? First and foremost when we have these events there is e-liquid markets. In other words liquidity becomes a premium participants disappear out of the market. Why would you take on risk when there's the potential for unknown? The second reason why volatility comes is that as price shifts, in other words as price moves up participants so the dynamic of price shifting brings in more participants that being said as i've said before volatility in theory breeds volatility breeds okay volatility leads to more volatility okay another reason uncertainty this is the real key uncertainty means that people unknown event or something that the market is concerned about People don't think in terms of you know rescue or they don't think in terms of anything other than I'm not price-sensitive I need to just get the hell out and clear my book and that's important to understand because Again, these are the underlying rules and principles that govern Risk event trading and the markets will be a liquid right as prices shift It's gonna bring in more and more participants different strategies different players exhaustion high exhaustion low trend trend It'll bring more volatility because volatility breeds volatility and obviously uncertainty means people are price Insensitive so you don't want to be fading certain risk events now obviously note That one of the key tips I can give you a full risk event trading is very simple, okay a lack of liquidity Implies the footprint becomes more relevant So less liquidity Okay, me", "transcript": "and third pattern, but we need to learn to identify very unique approaches to trading those.

You're probably scratching your head and thinking why? Well it's simple. Less liquidity means that you are going to see and spot certain interactions a lot clearer. The color lines will be clearer, the interactions will be clearer. For example, the data piece comes out, the market moves up, you're gonna know straight away what's Is someone selling it? Is someone buying it? You just got to see a simple bit of absorption or color lines or color delta. That's why as a rule of thumb and my tip for this strategy session, lack of liquidity implies the footprint becomes more valuable. So learn to utilize the footprint over economic data, market releases and central banks. Now before we get on to the actual examples as well as the live example, the last thing I want preparation okay now if you follow the live trading that I do sometimes you'll often see me trade over economic data you'll see that I'm always extremely well prepared okay by preparation I mean fundamentally okay so I know exactly what data piece is coming out I know what the markets sensitive to I know what the outliers are and I base a certain I create a certain strategy based on those fundamentals equally I know the technical landscape okay so I Where they keep levels, is there a delta, is there some opportunity in terms of technical aspects. So I prepare extremely well and that goes for every single risk event. If you want to become good at them, you can't just know the patterns, because the patterns will ultimately play out, but you have to be prepared to execute based on whichever pattern comes and that boils down to preparation. Ultimately, I highlighted every single one of the principles that we spoke about at the beginning of this strategy session, is that you're going to require every one of those principles to develop a contextual understanding. In other words, sometimes the market might go trend trend and you might look at the data piece and go and say, oh wow, why did that go so high, it's not even a What you have to recognize is that the markets don't do what you think they should do.

Equally, sometimes Donald Trump might become president and the whole world says that's going to create the biggest collapse in the global equity markets. What ends up happening? Okay, so again, the whole purpose of this entire course was to get you away from that subjective thinking, that idea of regurgitating what the newspapers, journalists say and instead develop an approach based on the facts and that's what the three patterns identify and now I'm going to show you effectively how to ultimately execute on every one of those patterns. The key to this is you're obviously going to notice in the price action, price is going to move very aggressively, you're going to struggle to get in here. You've got to be extremely aggressive and you've got to execute in this first little bit of consolidation. This is where you want to be entering and you're looking for that secondary move higher. Very simple in terms of stop, you can keep a really tight stop here. What I would say, if you have enough time to interpret the outlier, if it is massive Because in essence, if they're offering you a better price, you actually want to be buying more, you don't want to be stopping out. So in the example of a trend trend, yes you do need to stop, but again you can afford to be a little bit wider. Second example, initiative with a little bit of consolidation, in this example again we want to be a buyer on the way up, aggressively on the way up, once the market does exhaust itself, back off, sad stand out, and again try and initiate in front the imbalance okay do note once we take out this initial pullback zone be very cautious why because we know through other units once the market does re-enter that low volume area or that balanced area it's likely to begin the process of filling out okay so again very logical stops which we obviously created when we spoke about imbalance strategies the last one again reversal one This is where we protect ourselves. So once we get long, we do want to have a point where the market should not get below That's why we always have a stop. It is to protect us in the event that the market does do a Initiative initiative reversal what I would say and this is where the whole concept of again being determined and not just giving up Okay What this trade strategy does provide you with is when we do take out that starting point The loss that you incurred buying here and potentially being stopped here you can make back by selling on the red line", "transcript": "data piece and go and say, oh wow, why did that go so high, it's not even a What you have to recognize is that the markets don't do what you think they should do.

Those are our three strategy approaches. Now let's go and have a look and see what this looks like on the footprint charts and then look at some practical examples. So in our first example, this is the UK CPI from December. It was on the 12th of December and this is the Pound Sterling. It's a five-minute rotation. Okay, so obviously what we're looking for at this point We don't know which one of the three strategies is in play But we do know how we want to execute based on whichever pattern the market shows us Okay, so that allows us to be objective at all times and not enforce too much of an opinion on the market now note Market flipped up and we suddenly got quite a lot of absorption. So we could have been a buyer in this assuming this was a potential for initiative and consolidation We then got a new high market pullback. This is our gentle little clue. Okay, so we can see this does occur at the base of the selling that we received on the way up and ultimately we can see again the buyers sat there just absorbing the market as well as buying. the market then did extend so we were very easily able to recognize that this trade wasn't going to quite continue in a trend trend like fashion and potentially we were on for some form of a either more of a distribution type play or even a reversal type play now the market ended up coming back into this imbalance began the process of filling out Before then actually even not just getting below it, but then ultimately Reversing so this is the first example like I was saying to in terms of reversal what will always happen in reversal plays Yes, you might lose money initially being a buyer higher up, which is fine But don't forget that the market will always give you another opportunity And if you switched on to it you could have been a seller in this point looking for potential continuation Also, if you weren't a seller at this point, a little bit of an inside candle here again gave you another opportunity before we had the very aggressive delta shift to the downside. Okay, so that's our first trade example. Our second example then is the gold. This is from the FOMC in December. Now note, obviously, this is on the 13th of December, and again, I haven't really got the numbers here. I want to focus more on the colors. their hiked rates remain with the idea that they're going to hike again three times next year. What we can see is a lot of dark colors at the extremes and all over the show so we can see dark pink, dark pink, dark pink, dark pink, dark blue, dark blue.

Now what's interesting about this is obviously if we look in essence what the market did at the end ultimately it did go higher but was being absorbed by buyers. In other words, markets came down prices but ultimately the buyers won the net result and we had a high-volume search. We can see it again in the next rotation, look at the dark color. So all that selling, all that victory taking place from the sellers, but ultimately prices are starting to rise. We can imagine, you see, once all that absorption occurred we started to see the buyers become more aggressive, more aggressive before ultimately moving prices higher. Okay, so that's a secondary example. Again, This is a little bit more of a blip up, consolidate. Okay, so straight away, no real tradeable opportunity. And like I said, opportunity number one, trend, trend, is a very straightforward tradeable opportunity. Opportunity number two, slightly less. Okay, more of a trader's market. Option number three, very much a trader's market, which is pay attention to all the footprint principles you've learned and execute accordingly. Okay, don't forget, like we said. When prices move aggressively, it brings in a whole bunch of participants. Therefore, it's going to give you a whole bunch of opportunities Okay, and that's why risk event trading is so important Not just for the footprint but also for trading in general. Okay, the last example Again, this is now obviously and that's the video we're gonna watch. This was when Flynn said he was going to expose exposed Trump. This is the gold market 13th of December Again, all I want to show you before we get to the video. Look at the light shading Some very aggressive selling being bought up, very aggressive buying, a little bit of a holding pattern, initiative again, initiative again. So again this is the key that we're interested in, that's a relatively strong move like you'll see in a minute, really, really strong impulse move, so we get the impulse move, a secondary impulse, a consolidation and another impulse. So within that it's relatively easy to execute and leverage yourself up. Okay, in terms of execution, like I said, we're looking for a really aggressive execution. Most traders would have been executing and potentially buying more than looking to run it up the page. Okay, let's now go and have a look at the example of this Flynn and see what it looks like in the markets. Now, obviously, it's quite aggressive, so do pay attention, but the first thing I want to bring to your attention is remember when these events come out, liquidity disappears lose its head. So you have to be quite aggressive, you have to show intent, you have to be willing to be aggressive", "transcript": "their hiked rates remain with the idea that they're going to hike again three times next year.

So you have to be quite aggressive, you have to show intent, you have to be willing to be aggressive and leverage yourself up early. So we can see no real nothing's hit the wires yet you'll notice the shift in the market and obviously this was a data release on the 2nd of December in the gold market. No notes on the day also what again this is why it's so important to know the context. Note the delta okay really big And ultimately, you know, if we were aware of this before the number, you would have recognized that, you know, if prices suddenly start to rise, we could very well see a Delta unwind. And that's pretty much what you're going to see in the next couple of minutes. Okay, so the news is about to hit the wires. And I'm just going to move this one a little bit. Okay. So the news has hit the wires. So we can see an initial imbalance. Not a great deal of volume. Where the footprint is so great because liquidity disappears look how obvious we can see the orders okay? So look at this stand out by yeah, okay? That's not even like that's not even a big participant remember Big influential participants don't have footprints. Okay. They'll be hearing this news a lot later than most these are simply algorithms So look at these orders look at this dark blue dark blue dark blue Okay, so we can really see something has shifted the nature of the market. Now everyone's starting to pick up, and now we're starting to see the market really take off. So again, you know, in this first bit, you can really clearly see how the footprint gives you an extreme advantage. Again, note, what are we seeing here? Look at the high here. Yes, we're seeing selling. What are we seeing? All that selling being absorbed, equally selling being absorbed and buying and buying. So we're seeing selling being absorbed at the extreme of the day and more buying. Again, very useful if you've got a footprint tool. If you don't, you can't quite see this as easily. Now, obviously, if we didn't get in on these dark blue colors, we definitely wanted to be in on this absorption lower down, looking for that extension, looking for that continuation. Again, obviously, we do get a little bit of a blip-up in the markets. We run into a little bit of responsive selling, so this is that sideways bit of trade that you saw, maybe a little bit of profit-taking note. When you get trend-trend, it's very unlikely there's new positioning. It's simply just a bit of responsive price action, probably a little bit of profit-taking, maybe a little bit of speculative shorts, just trying to take a couple of increments. exhaustion high. So the market just takes a little break off the exhaustion high", "transcript": "like in the markets. Now, obviously, it's quite aggressive, so do pay attention, but the first thing I want to bring to your attention is remember when these events come out, liquidity disappears lose its head. So you have to be quite aggressive, you have to show intent, you have to be willing to be aggressive and leverage yourself up early. So we can see no real nothing's hit the wires yet you'll notice the shift in the market and obviously this was a data release on the 2nd of December in the gold market. No notes on the day also what again this is why it's so important to know the context. Note the delta okay really big And ultimately, you know, if we were aware of this before the number, you would have recognized that, you know, if prices suddenly start to rise, we could very well see a Delta unwind. And that's pretty much what you're going to see in the next couple of minutes. Okay, so the news is about to hit the wires. And I'm just going to move this one a little bit. Okay. So the news has hit the wires. So we can see an initial imbalance. Not a great deal of volume. Where the footprint is so great because liquidity disappears look how obvious we can see the orders okay? So look at this stand out by yeah, okay? That's not even like that's not even a big participant remember Big influential participants don't have footprints. Okay. They'll be hearing this news a lot later than most these are simply algorithms So look at these orders look at this dark blue dark blue dark blue Okay, so we can really see something has shifted the nature of the market. Now everyone's starting to pick up, and now we're starting to see the market really take off. So again, you know, in this first bit, you can really clearly see how the footprint gives you an extreme advantage. Again, note, what are we seeing here? Look at the high here. Yes, we're seeing selling. What are we seeing? All that selling being absorbed, equally selling being absorbed and buying and buying. So we're seeing selling being absorbed at the extreme of the day and more buying. Again, very useful if you've got a footprint tool. If you don't, you can't quite see this as easily. Now, obviously, if we didn't get in on these dark blue colors, we definitely wanted to be in on this absorption lower down, looking for that extension, looking for that continuation. Again, obviously, we do get a little bit of a blip-up in the markets. We run into a little bit of responsive selling, so this is that sideways bit of trade that you saw, maybe a little bit of profit-taking note. When you get trend-trend, it's very unlikely there's new positioning.

So the market just takes a little break off the exhaustion high before continuing high. Again notice the footprint. Look at the colors at the extreme there. Really really large buying. Buyers holding the market quite aggressively high. Note delta still minus two thousand so we know that you know price is moving higher. This delta still has room to unwind and that's what we're going to ultimately see. We're going to see this keep moving higher. Again notice the imbalance on the next leg Note again, very aggressive buying at the high. So this is a real characteristic of trend trend. The market does tend to hold at the extreme, really forces you into the extreme if you do want to partake and that's the real edge behind this trade is to be aggressive. Okay, obviously it does extend. You can obviously watch this in your own time and eventually the market does form a top and settle down. Note again, the top formed on an exhaustion high also with an imbalance just before the exhaustion high. Okay. So that's the gold example then. Our second example will be in the Euro. This is the Euro CPI. This is a little bit more of a mundane, boring type risk event. But again, it goes to show that there are tradeable opportunities. So I'm just going to show you this. Obviously, we have received the European CPI data. Okay, we can see that the market, let me fast forward back a little bit. Okay, so we can see the data has come out. The Now we can see obviously market blips down quite a lot of selling. Notice all the red very aggressive selling very aggressive selling all the way down price moving in the direction again probably no real great opportunity to get in it was far too quick so what we're looking for obviously in this instance maybe the first pullback for a tradable opportunity otherwise we rather just out market comes back notice fills in the first of the imbalances trades and offering back down to the low. So that would have been our potential trade opportunity on this risk event and ultimately then the market begins the process of distributing within the low bounce. Okay, those are two examples. Obviously we will have two more examples of risk events in the drill section.
