This is unit 11 strategy 6. And let's get straight into it then. The initiative drive, the first thing we spoke about with regards to this... particular trade strategy is the when does it occur. We spoke about time being quite an important component of this trade strategy simply because the pattern that we're going to likely observe will be different whether it's at the open of the cash session or in the midpoint of a trading session. So what we've got is the E-mini S&P 500 in front of us. The cash has just opened so this is the We can see the market opens, initially tests a little bit lower, finds some sort of a reload absorption and begins the process of accumulation. So at this point we don't know if there's an initiative drive, we don't know if there's a cash drive, all we know is that the market is open right now. So there's no real information that we can take from this as the market opens up. So important, as we spoke about with regards to the strategy, is to acknowledge and accept that when there is initiative in the market, we don't want to be fading the market. We don't want to go counter the initiative. If anything, we want to get on with the initiative trade in the direction of the initiative. We also said that when initiative comes from the open of the cash drive, it's a very you know to to get onto the pullback and the reason being is has to do with the liquidity we noted that uh... particularly on the initiative drive uh... someone is looking for as much liquidity as they can find and the less liquidity being provided the more aggressive the market will move in one direction That being said then, so we can see a real chunky open here. Quite a lot of volume transacted, a good 10,000 contracts taken at the open and we can see now the market has gone back but now I'm just going to move this a little bit forward We can see that in this first rotation suddenly, we get a bit of an outside rotation, in other words we opened, tested below the previous rotation, but closed above the previous rotation. So quite an aggressive open there, the market finally resolved itself on a 5 minute rotation. suddenly we start to see the market go bid up quite aggressively. Note of course the imbalance. Okay so an aggressive 594 by 900 imbalance, 47 by 591, 199 by 1600. So quite an aggressive imbalance taking hold here.

If this was an imbalance strategy we would ultimately look for the next rotation to see if that imbalance ultimately holds. Note, into the next rotation, the imbalance does hold, we've come back, we can see that imbalance quite aggressive there, a real strong signal of intense scent from the buyers. Again, like I said, the trickiest part about an initiative drive is that we don't always tend to get onto the initial drive. It's about being patient, interpreting that initial drive through factors that you can observe. Once you have seen the initiative, you then employ the strategy that we've spoken about throughout this unit 11. We'll talk about that a little bit more once we have fully played through the So we can see the market came back down again where we saw massive absorption that's now hulled. The markets failed to penetrate lower and we've then flung up again. Okay, very typical of initiative drive. It does tend to drive, absorb, drive, absorb, drive, absorb, drive, absorb. So we've seen this process of driving and absorption at the moment and again the next rotation we drive again and we're seeing the higher absorption. Okay, so we noted, obviously, that this was quite crucial in terms of the strategy. And once the market had showed us that initiative drive and begun the process of a pullback, we would then be looking for an entry point. Now what we didn't really go over was exact entry points and this is the tricky part about an initiative drive. There's no real exact entry point. There's a number of ways you can get in. You understand the aggressive nature on the market but the problem is that the entry point isn't always dependent on an exact What is crucial is we want to look for regions. So that's what we're trying to find. We're trying to find regions that ultimately could give us opportunity for entry. Now, looking at the example we've got currently, we can see that one region definitely would pay attention to, is this little chunk of volume, this high-volume area or pocket positioning. We saw a good strong delta of $3,600 being accumulated in that two-price region. And then we can see obviously our next little region of accumulation and pocket positioning was this little spot here where we saw a buyer really step it up, take $6500 that was offered.

Some other metrics you can use. I do like to get a little fib retracement up, maybe from the low of the drive to the That also works quite well and then yeah, sometimes maybe you get an imbalance which can be quite handy and you just apply the imbalance strategy in terms of the execution methodology to get on board with the initiative drive. Okay, now with RISC's initiative drive we can see obviously we have begun the process of sideways trading now. Note every time it comes down, okay we sold 563 and the market went back but we came down again to that price, traded 1020 lots, went back but came down a third time, traded So we can see this acting as a real barrier now, not necessarily support, it's most likely just that liquidity person who's looking for the liquidity, just getting the position filled out. Like we used an example of Goldman Sachs, Goldman Sachs will be initiating up. When they find the seller, you'll see this. That's the two-way trade, the absorption. They'll then initiate again. When they find the seller, you'll get the two-way trade, as we can see. And when they initiate again, and when they find the seller, we'll get the two-way trade again. So now all we're seeing is Goldman's no longer initiating, but allowing the market Okay, so in terms of entry point, we can very clearly see this is the line in the sand, this is where it's being absorbed, anywhere down to this 93.5, so from 93.5 to 94.5, we are looking for long side trades. We'll see what the market does once it comes down and tests again this area. So we can see it comes down again, this time, note, failing a little bit higher. So last time we managed to get down to 94.25, this time we only managed to get to 94.5. Note also the lack of selling, 34 lots only, 7 lots only, 12 lots only, 8 lots only. In other words, the sellers are becoming less and less interested to sell at lower This is a very important clue.
