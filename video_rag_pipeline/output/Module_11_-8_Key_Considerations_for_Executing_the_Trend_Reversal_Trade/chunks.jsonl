Now, as you can see on this slide, we have a gear stick there and it's really important to be able to know when the market is shifting its gears. And shifting its gears, when you're driving a car, what is shifting its gears? It's when you're going from fast speed to low speed or you're really revving the car. So it's understanding when that market is revving in a different form. So knowing when speed at 120 miles per hour and then and then all of a sudden it has new bends in the road or new curves or new or new obstacles and those obstacles in the price ladder environment are new orders that come into the market so when you face with new obstacles in the road you then are shifting down your gears slowing down becoming more cautious not going at the same speed and that's really key in determining your strategy that you'll be deploying on the price ladder Now firstly number one, you want to observe the current trend personality and define its activity so again you want to you want to as if you're driving a car you want to determine the speed that the market is going and And once you work out that once you understand the speed that it's going well Then you'll be able to quickly work on and quickly analyze when that speed starts changing on the price on the price ladder So second you wait for an observable clear alteration so that obstacle in the road or that new bend you want to observe that very clear to stay and it's got to be clear it mustn't you you don't want to be dancing on the on the gray area say oh that looks a little bit slow faster it's got to be it's got to be something observable is it that blowout attack reversal is all of a sudden the market is crescendoed and then you see a big you know a seller step in the market it's got to be clear you can't just wanting to pick a high or pick a bottom as the market will the market price and a temporary halt or potential reversal of the trend so you want to observe that complete change and then once you've observed that now depending if it's a flip that's come to market and absorb a distributor a a market that's completely crescendoed and lost its volatility well then all of a sudden you can deploy the appropriate trend reversal strategy and the three main ones where we've spoken about the on the distribution types in the in the absorption zone where you get particular icebergs or new buy orders or time slice orders or volume slice orders but in this instance we're looking at a crescendo in volume or the volume blowout attack reversal which is effectively a grade one reversal pattern which we'll be looking at on the price that and we're looking how to deploy it especially when you see a cluster of low volume zone low volume", "transcript": "Okay, so they really key considerations for executing the trend reversal trade.
