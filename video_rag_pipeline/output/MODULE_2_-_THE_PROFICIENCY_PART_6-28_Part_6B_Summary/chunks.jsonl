Now what did we talk about in the early section of Part 6? Well, we started off talking about markets that open in balance and markets that open out of balance. Now, the important thing to understand when talking about a market opening within balance or trading within balance and out of balance is what the implications mean for risk and reward. So, very basically, to depict the example, if we had that being our previous day's distribution and this was our sort of, you know, our accepted area of volume or our, you If we open the next day somewhere within the previous day's accepted area where 70% of the volume is traded, that market is said to be in balance. imbalance with a previous day, there's a lot of acceptance between buyers and sellers at those prices and for that very reason, we have much lower risk attached to the market aggressively moving in one direction or the other. Of course, this can change over a period of a session or a couple of sessions, but However, also remember with lower probability of risk, there's also lower probability of opportunity. In other words, we need to almost bide our time and be a lot more patient waiting for strategy to develop. So that was our first example. We then turned our attention to markets that are out of balance. So if we open somewhere in the sort of, you know, the top quartile or somewhere in the bottom quartile, that would be a market that is opening out of balance. Now again, the converse to imbalance is that a market out of balance shows a lot more volatility as a result of being out of balance. This volatility implies that there's higher risk in taking trade setups, but equally higher opportunity for opportunity. to take advantage of this opportunity. So again, it's important to understand, when we're in balance, that means lower risk, less opportunity, when we're out of balance, that means higher risk. but also higher or more opportunities to make money. So that is what we started off with. We then moved on and spoke about the four unique open trade patterns. I spoke about some of the characteristics of these open patterns and the levels of confidence they give you in the potential for opportunity over the course of the day.

Now what we're gonna quickly do is I'm just gonna go over the four patterns with you again just to refresh your memory. The first one we had was an open drive which is also the most aggressive of the patterns. So the market opens and it initiates in one direction and once the cash market comes in this initial what we call a tail gives us the strong bias for prices to continue upward over the initial part of the session. Most important, we said, that opening price becomes a key reference point for us in the market. So that was our first most aggressive trade open pattern that we saw. Our next trade pattern that we saw would be the open test drive. So again, the market would open. It would then test a key reference point. Now that reference point could be a low of day, it could be maybe a value area low, it could be a volume pointer control, it could be any number of things, it could be a low volume area, but merely it tests, it almost pokes to see is there going to be some sort of an initiative response from buyers in this case. That's what it does and once it finds them or runs into that longer time frame, the marker very aggressively catapults in the opposite direction and we get the initiative move. Again, the open test drive is quite an aggressive play. We do tend to look for strategies that can be employed towards the upside so long as this K-tail and this opening level remain. That was our second open type we could see in the markets the third open type was the open Rejection reversal now this play type is a is similar to the open test drive But it really almost it can be quite a confusing player because the market will open It will then move in one direction But it will look as though the early trend is toward the downside But in effect what's occurring is the market is just trying to find where the liquidity is going to come from, where we're going to see some very strong response of buying step into the market. And once it finds that response of buying, the market then turns around, retests that opening price, but more importantly catapults above the opening price. price.

So that's our third open day type and our fourth is the open auction. is probably the most boring of the four, and also represents maybe the least opportunity in the sense that there's no natural bias for direction. So the open auction is merely the market opens, it can auction up, it can auction down, it then goes up, it then goes down, and it merely just distributes in a balancing type opener. There's a high tendency to find this open in both balanced and imbalanced markets. The important thing is to identify early on, if the market's auctioning on both sides of the open, there's a high likelihood of early balance, or let me rephrase, early distribution in the market. So those are the four types of opens we spoke about. We then discussed our three trade locations in the market in terms of where the previous day's volume value area is. value area or volume value area. The first would be when we open in balance, sorry the first would be when we open in value, in range. So we open within the previous day's most accepted value area. The second would be if we open out of value but still in range. So again we either open below or above the value area low and the value area high. Volume value area, volume value area. That would be where we still open in range but slightly out of balance. And the third, which is the most aggressive and the most significant, would be when we open out of value but also out of range. So those are the three types of trade locations we spoke about. And we mentioned what the different trade locations imply for the potential for opportunity. Then, what we spoke about was some very, very strong strategies that you can employ when you see gaps in the market.
