Now a typical definition of a trend reversal is a change in the trend direction of the market in a specific timeframe being analyzed. Timeframe being obviously a subjective interpretation, whether you look at the one minute or the daily, but obviously the larger the timeframe, the more observable that can be seen. What we also be looking at is the price ladder pattern observations can give a dynamic real-time ability to determine when a trend is exhausting yourself or having a rest before the charts provide us with this information. So really rather important you know at the at the climax of a trend or the absolute trough of a trend when that final turning point happens that turning point? What are the subtle clues? What is the auctioning environment like at those turning points? And then what type of trading strategy do you deploy in those areas? So when the market is quiet and lethargic and losing any type of initiative activity, what happens when the market starts turning over and then the positions start unraveling the other end? Or when you have a crescendo of a move, what does that look like? What are the price low volume nodes, a bit of distribution happening on the latter, a couple of large orders coming into the market. What does that look like? We're going to be looking at a couple of videos of identifying that and then really supplying the live trading drill practice to consolidate that learning. Next it's a change as we mentioned. It's a change in the price personality with personality being defined by the following characteristics The auctioning speed what is the auctioning speed? You know has that changed as the market has moved to that territory What what is the auto tie the order type initiation? Is it large orders or just very? passive orders going through the market, really slow orders going to the market relative to how the market shifted in that direction, so really important considerations. What's the market velocity, remember market velocity being defined, how many lots affected the speed of the market, how many lots per second or how many lots per minute. If it's going now at 5 lots per second as opposed to an hour ago, it was going at 105 lots per second, well now we know that the market is just losing interest, type plays that you want to be aiming towards at critical levels for the upside start becoming null and void because the market velocity has slowed down and generally speaking you know at a lot of turning points if it's not a crescendo move the market velocity does slow down before it shifts the other way or unless there's a big absorption pattern. You need to understand the time frame you're operating in in order to know how to deploy the correct strategy and that's that's important I mean you could have a big daily level and the market comes in", "transcript": "Okay, so what is a trend reversal?

So knowing which time frame you're operating in is very critical on the reversal patterns because if you're looking for reversal on a multi-day chart that could take a couple of days whereas you might just at those levels look for hourly plays for hourly sculpts as you see the market are losing its momentum. And then also figuring out what type of trading strategy you're going to deploy. You're going to be looking at rapid scalping versus positioning. So once you observe an area that you see that the market is now slowing down or unable to penetrate higher, are you going to look to build a core position or are you going to work yourself? Have you ever noticed an absorption type pattern? Are you going to work with the absorber like we discussed in our absorption videos? Do you just position yourself so that if the market has come all the way down and found the zone where it's losing activity and market velocity is slowing down but you see someone just sitting on the bid, reloads, do you sit in there with the buyer and you keep on buying with the buyer until he disappears and you scope in that direction and whilst building a core position. So there's multiple little strategies to trade around and those strategies, we're not going to be doing videos on those plays in this module because we've already discussed those absorption plays. the absorption section at trend reversal points because the purpose of this section is to look at one specific type of reversal play and that's the crescendo move the blowout reversal play as opposed to other reversal plays being predominantly the absorption or distribution type plays.
