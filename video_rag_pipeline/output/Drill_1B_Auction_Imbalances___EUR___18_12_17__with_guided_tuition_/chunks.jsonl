This is for strategy for the auction imbalances. I hope you've enjoyed that unit. I think auction imbalances are a wonderful aspect of the footprint tool and even if you don't necessarily trade the strategy, the standalone strategy, the actual auction imbalance can really aid you in some of your other strategies. Let's just get straight onto the footprint. What we can see is quite a build up in volume. This is the Eurodollar 5 minute rotation. Note I'm not using an imbalance rotation setting here. You can obviously set those. So you're really going to be tested here, or you would have been really tested, in terms of identifying those imbalances. We can see straight away a bit of a break up comes and our first imbalance is left on the chart. So that's the first thing we can see. A nice little imbalance from the 60s up to the 65s, a real lack of trade taking place. We've got 14 by 15, 8 by 24, 3 by 47, 41 by 74, 26 by 107, quite a lot of imbalance on the diagonals. The first thing we obviously noted is that this in its own is not our strategy, our strategy is to wait for the rotation, let it come back and test ultimately that imbalance area before Do note, obviously we spoke quite important, is the volume. Volume is a real identifier in terms of continuation of the imbalance and how aggressive that continuation might be, where if we have low volume, there's a much higher probability that the imbalance will reverse itself and fill itself out. That being said we can straight away see that you know really really dark volume on this breakup 2370 contracts So we could see there's a real Intent in terms of the volume and I think that's that's the first thing we need to observe high volume You know break to the upside with an imbalance does suggest. We've got the potential for a little bit of extension So what we're looking for now is that first little bit of absorption on a retest of the ultimate imbalance. Now, the imbalance area starts, we can see obviously we've got a 3 by 51 there, and then we've got a 52 by 114. So depending on your settings, we can see that imbalance starts somewhere around that 118.62.5 area. So let's get back to the next rotation, let's see what it looks like. So our next rotation comes in. And let's see what happens now. We're looking for a fill or we're looking firstly for a little bit of absorption And then we're going to execute a market now note Again, most of the time in almost every single one of the strategies we've dealt with, I", "transcript": "So welcome to this drill session.

We're looking for a fill or we're looking firstly for a little bit of absorption And then we're going to execute a market now note Again, most of the time in almost every single one of the strategies we've dealt with, I always sort of prefer you to not preempt the market. I prefer you to wait for a signal, wait for the market to give you the clue. Now the clue in this strategy is to wait for the absorption ahead of the elephant. So we're looking for any kind of absorption around the 62, 62 and a half marker for us to ultimately execute this trade strategy. Okay, so we can see market comes down it trades a one lot at that previous dark area now again We might be tempted to get in here. We might be tempted to jump in and and jump on that And again, yes, this is one of the real factors you have to be disciplined with this trade strategy. You've got to say to yourself, if you're jumping in at this price point, you're foregoing two prices. Now again, in the long run two prices, or in the short run two prices might not seem like a lot, but in the long run those two prices add up equally, the lack of discipline shown will come out and catch you at some point. less in terms of profit, it means you're taking two prices and more in terms of risk. So in effect the net net is actually a four tick swing in the event that it does go wrong. So just factor that in when you're obviously considering this trade strategy. Okay so let's just move the tape on a little bit forward, let's get to that point. Okay, so bang, market comes down, it trades up, right, 62 and a half straight, 9 contracts trades, comes back again, 19 contracts trades. Note what it's doing in front. Okay, note how we're getting quite a little bit of absorption here, quite a lot of selling coming in here. So we're seeing the absorption taking place in a bit, the reloading's taking place, 53.76. So the buyers are happy to be reloading. We've now looking, or we've got our fill, or we're trying to be a buyer of 62.5s which we filled there, or we can lift the 63s, but we've now got our fill. So we've seen the absorption taking place in front of the elephant, and that's given to enter. Again note the continuation of the absorption, no real buying taking place, mostly just selling into the 62s and a halfs and 63s. Okay, so this is the absorption we're looking out for, this is the kind of price response, the signal we're looking for in order to initiate. Now, In terms of the risk, as we said, we always keep our risk inside of the low volume area, inside of the imbalance, okay. That's the real key.

I never wanted to come across like that. the important part is now as you're going through your template what you should have noticed about this entire imbalance, and I'm going to fast-forward it to show you, you should have noted that this imbalance had a number of rotations.

I can tell you this was a very slow imbalance, it's very unusual to have seen this many rotations before the market then extended.
