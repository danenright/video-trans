What we've got here is a chart dating back to 1986. Now the first major hiking cycle from 86 all the way up to 89, we can see the solid dark blue line, that's effectively the Fed funds futures rate, that's the US Fed hiking cycle. Now as that goes up we can see a very strong correlation with the US 10 year treasury yields which is the luminous light green colour there. Every time the Fed initiated a hiking cycle, we could see a very strong positive correlation with the US 10-year treasury yields. As interest rates rose, we saw 10-year treasury yields rise. Now the conundrum is what happened in 2004. We can see a very aggressive, gradual 25 basis point rate hike cycle starting in June 2004. However, this time around, we can see that the US treasury tenure did not quite go as expected based on the previous three hiking cycles. Now just imagine this hiking cycle lasted almost two years. Imagine the frustration and the pain and the losses that a lot of institutions and traders would have taken as a result of relying too much on the past. What's the moral of the story? Yes, it's good to have a subjective idea. Yes, it's good to look into the past for guidance. But if something is not occurring as it should, if the objective facts are not being given to us by the marketplace, we need to ensure that we're not committing too much capital and energy to that trade. So had we remained objective in this example in 2004, Yes, we might have lost a little bit of money, but we wouldn't have lost two years of our lives trying to fight something that wasn't happening, trying to pre-empt something that was not happening. So just remember, history doesn't always repeat itself. Just because something happens in one instance doesn't mean it will repeat itself. That's the example. Now what I want to lead you to think about is the Fed started hiking in December 2015. So, based on history, a lot of people are saying, well, the yield curve should begin to rise. Now, as of the date of doing this course, yield curves haven't started to rise. In fact, yields have continued to move lower. So again, we're seeing a very similar instance as we did back in 2004 when the rate hike cycle was going up, yields don't necessarily have to go higher as well.", "transcript": "So let's take a look at this conundrum and see why people were so baffled.
