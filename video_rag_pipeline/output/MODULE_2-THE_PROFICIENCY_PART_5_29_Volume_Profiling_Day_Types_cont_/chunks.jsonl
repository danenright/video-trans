The name is, it has two distributions and this is formed by initially seeing a little bit of two-way trade, a lot of acceptance with a little bit of initiative and then further two-way trade. But let's look at some of the characteristics of what creates a double distribution day. So initially the market is quite inactive as there's a low level of conviction, in other words there's very little conviction to either move up or down. Note then, we also do have a relatively small initial balance and this is again an early identifier of a lack of conviction and interest in the market. But a change in events, whether it may be fundamental, whether it may be technical, or maybe a large order comes into the market, this suddenly creates initiative. And it's this initiative that breaks us out of the initial range. Now note, it does tend to leave a low volume area, or an untraded area of prices. This untraded area is crucial in a double distribution day, as again it gives a and lean towards one direction or the other. And note, you tend to get, well, in the double distribution is that these single prints or this low volume area will tend to hold and so long as it holds the market will continue to trend or hold the directional trend for the rest of the day. Now the reason that this low volume area or single prints is crucial is because it gives us the directional bias. So the question ultimately we have to say is that if the low volume area is filled, effectively the impetus is now gone and the low volume area will likely be filled in and we'll no longer have a double distribution day. So the question you have to ask yourself when it comes to a double distribution, to So long as we don't fill, we'll hold the trend. Now in the example as you can see, the market opened and spent the first sort of hour and a half just moving sideways in a relatively small initial balance. We then got a little bit of buying interest but the market couldn't really aggressively move up and we got a real lack of conviction trade for some period of time. However, at some point all of a sudden initiative was taken by the buyers, we quickly aggressively moved higher until we ran into responsive sell side action and once those responsive sellers entered the market we then started to see two way trade. Now the crucial thing to understand is that we only want to be looking for buy side", "transcript": "The double distribution is the second trend type that you can typically find.
