The important thing to understand is the auctioning that occurs at the highs or the lows when we form an excess top. Again, the length of the tail, depending on the market you're trading, is crucial because that is telling us how quickly the other time frame will shut back down. So in this example we can see not the biggest tail in the world, but a relatively sort of bigger tail, and that's telling us that sellers very quickly shut down the buyers that we're initiating and move prices quite quickly lower. Notice, well, how once we auctioned that top, once we found that top, the market then very quickly navigated away from that top and sellers took complete control and continued to initiate prices and we even took out the low of the day and extended towards the downside. So we can see we saw some real strong initiative being taken by the sellers and the buyers got overwhelmed in this example. So again we can see how these excess top, not only did they give us, the tail gave but it gave us quite a bit of opportunity to hop on with the initiative selling that continued to occur over the course of the day. Then, note the volume in the extreme. We could see where in the first example with a loss of momentum we saw a lot of two-way trade, in this example in the top quartile or in the higher prices, we would have seen a real lack of volume being facilitated between buyers and sellers. Why? Because the buyers got shut down very quickly, so there was a lack of interest from buyers to be buying at higher prices, and sellers quickly took advantage of those higher prices. much two-way traders we would have had in the first example used. And then the rotation of the speed on the way down. Like I said in the earlier slide, it's all about assessing how does the market move back down. Is it aggressive, in which case we're seeing aggressive initiative, or is it a lot more slow where we're seeing a lot more two-way interaction.
