What we're going to talk about is what we spoke about in the second half of part 7. We got some really, really exciting principles where we started off talking about some of the major control variables that you'll find within the auction process. These control variables we broke down into strength and something that shows us almost Then, we spoke about weak auction process signals that the market can show us sometimes in the auction process. Some of those, let's go through them. you know, variables, control variables, and the first was where the VPOC is located. We spoke about how, you know, we can have a VPOC shifting over a period of day as the market accepts higher and higher prices, and we spoke about how, as the market is moving up aggressively, if it's shifting, you know, that VPOC up with it or going We then also spoke about the closing price and where that price closes on the day, being significant for potential early direction the next day. We spoke about the location of the value area. In other words, where are we trading today based on yesterday we're trading in a value, outside a value. We spoke about range expansion. Does the market and the volume show us an expansion? Are we doing much bigger ranges in the previous day? Is there a lot more relative volume? Is volume generally high? All these types of factors show us a lot of control variable strength. Lastly, we spoke about tails. Those were some of the control variables that show strength in the markets and real sort of almost bias toward either the upside in price or to the downside. We then spoke about weak signals or weak control variables that the market sends us. things that appear in the volume profile that almost go against what the principle is. We spoke about that. We then spoke about bad highs and lows, whether they're a bad high with multiple TPO's or whether it's a bad high or low with a high amount of volume. the high of the day, but also we have a point of control being at the low of the day. So something that you don't very often see where the market might spend", "transcript": "Hey guys, welcome back to part 7b, Blackboard Learning Series.

So something that you don't very often see where the market might spend a large amount of time at one side of the or at one price, but it transacts a high amount of volume at another price. We then also spoke about low volume areas and We then also spoke about various other types of weak control variables. We summarized the two, but most importantly, we identified what strong and weak. control variables mean to us when we develop our strategies. Don't forget, every one of these principles that I go through with you, I go through because it gives you just that little bit more understanding about the dynamic and context of the market. If you understand the principles, you can develop the most incredible trade strategies We then moved on and we spoke about high-volume areas, low-volume areas, and ledges. And very simply, I'm just going to illustrate them, a high-volume area within a profile is where a market transacts a high amount of volume, a high amount of activity. We then have equally a low-volume area where the market might transact and transact And the last is where we have a ledge where the market is transacting but the manner in which it's auctioning it's forming almost a lack of impetus towards breaking above to the upside in this example or maybe even something along the lines of this where we have a ledge towards the downside. Now those ledges can be both volume based or TPO based. The important thing to understand is that those ledges at some point will get broken and there are a lot of stops that tend to be located in and above those ledges. So that's where we finished off part 7b. So that concludes the Blackboard Learning Series for part 7b. Part seven, now again, I cannot reiterate how important it is to spend a lot of time developing these principles, find these principles within the marketplace, apply these principles within the marketplace and develop your strategies based on these volume profile principles.
