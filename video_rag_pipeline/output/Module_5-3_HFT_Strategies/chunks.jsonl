A lot of people look at it as these really sophisticated quants and mathematical geniuses who design these machines. human abilities on our own. Ability to decipher markers from the the the financial future space so our traders on our trading floors of 99% of them are discretionary traders and And many of them are able to decipher patterns from the algorithms a lot more effectively and quicker so don't ever be intimidated by the space because Until until the machine can replicate this master operating system that we have within our skill, I would think that they're a long way from having the ability to compete with the discretionary trader. Now HFT strategies, let's define HFT in algorithms Again, as I mentioned, this is a formality section with no exercises, but necessary for the rest of the training program because when we talk in quite a few of our ladder videos and we start illustrating various training strategies and and plays on on the order book and the price ladder we will make some references to certain types of algorithms that we might be observing in the marketplace. Again most of the section is a self-study section to understand your major participants in the marketplace and before we clearly define them we will look at look at their place in the global financial market participant ecosystem and why it's important to understand them as they actively contribute towards 70% of intraday market liquidity. Then we also look at the types of market participants whilst we look through this entire ecosystem and the spectrum of market participants, which really has depth to the nth degree, but we look at really the major ones that we're trying to define. I want you to click on that link just for you to understand the HFT, the participants, gain a firm grasping.", "transcript": "Okay, let's have an understanding of the various types of HFT strategies and as you can see in the video it's really the depiction of effectively the world of the matrix.
