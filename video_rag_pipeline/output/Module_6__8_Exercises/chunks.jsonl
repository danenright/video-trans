Now what I want you to do is spend a dedicated week to watching the speed of the ladder and its relative movement. So just focus the rest of the week, before you go into any next module, is just focusing exclusively on the speed of the ladder and its relative movement and making the observations. Each day use the market velocity matrix to mark observations regarding the different velocity types like on the previous video explained and how I showed you how to mark the various different the various different rows and columns of that matrix. After you complete the entire course, then I want you to repeat this exercise by identifying price ladder patterns in combination with the market environment type. So once you've been through all the various different trading strategies, price ladder patterns that we show you and how to identify them, then I want you to come back to this matrix and when you see those various types of price ladder patterns, I want you volume activity, liquidity environment, and once you identify all of that, then you are able to quickly learn which ladder price strategies are more optimal to deploy in the marketplace. So good luck with this exercise, gain a lot of learning, and remember your learning is only aggressive if you are routine about it, and you are disciplined about it, You know deliberate intention and knowing what your objective from the exercises, so good luck", "transcript": "Now let's really accelerate your learning with the module 6 exercise.
