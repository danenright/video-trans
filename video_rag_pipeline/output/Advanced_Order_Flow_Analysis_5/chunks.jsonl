So as you see here on the left-hand side I have the I've written stop slash blowout candle in this big red candle here This this area here is a sort of a swing area support area which I liked in terms of not that I'd like but it's just a key area in terms of how you want to see price action trade guys you know what you hear me talk about you know structure uh... depict price actions you know this is the structure in terms of so right so this is see this is where you then need to work out the price action in here so what is it telling you know the structure in hand and how it trades This is what I had just noted here on the right, you see a key price ladder accumulation goes on in here, and this is where you've seen the stops and then this is the two-way trade you see above the area, the structure that you've just seen, and how we auction in here and how you can trade out, how you can get on this long move here.
