Now, bear in mind, we said to ourselves, when we have a low volume area, this shows us initiative. Now, straight away, we can see the market tries to form a double bottom. And notice how once the cash comes in, the cash market takes us all the way back distribution. So what we're looking for now, given that the previous day we had the low volume area at the high of the day, we're looking for any sort of rejection or speed off the lows to become a buyer.

So as you can see the market is trying to fill in the low volume area from the previous day. And every time it comes in towards the low of the day, the market gets lifted quite easily and quite aggressively. As we can see now, we have a higher low being formed on the P-print. Again we can see a higher low formed off the Q-print. And notice how the auction, we're starting to see a little bit of volume and volatility Now, note, the R print comes and it tests the initial balance high before then continuing higher and making a new high on the day. So what we can see here is not only are prices being bought up off the lows relatively easily but any sort of a pullback now as we've seen a little bit of buy side auction come into the market, that too is being easily bought up.

So had we been looking for longs, whether it was on the M and the N print, whether it was on an extension of the initial balance high, whatever it may have been, we'd be looking for longs as a result of the low volume area left on the previous day. So because of the initiative left on the previous day, we'd be looking for longs when the market shows us in the indication that there is buy side in the market. Now as we can see, the market is still struggling to make ground lower. We can see that the sellers are not committing to lower prices and the buyers keep absorbing and keep reloading on any sort of a pullback.

So what we're looking for is we're looking for either buy side opportunity towards the or we're looking to remain in longs so long as we can hold on to this little bit of support barrier being formed. Now once the W print comes in we can see that the market is now taking out the 50% of the day but it's also now starting to hold on to lower prices.

Notice how we shifted from having a lot of two-sided trade to one-time framing. Again, we can see the V print, the W and the X print all showing us one-time framing. Okay, again notice how quickly the market, once it got to lower prices, we saw a very of price. So the first thing you have to say to yourself with regards to a characteristic of this trade setup is that lower prices get picked up relatively easily. Now in noting that whenever you see this trade setup what you want to say to yourself is that when the market is offering lower prices ahead of a low volume area that seems pays out relatively quickly. So we saw both on the X print, we saw it on the M and N print and now let's see it on the B print as it plays out live. So as you can see the B print made a new low on the day and straight away it got lifted back up on the market very quickly reversed in the opposite direction. So we can see it on the M print, the N print, the X print and the B print. So the market's given us four separate opportunities to get The question is, the second characteristic is, we see a lot of buying both passive and initiative, and that we saw both the initiative of the lows, but then also the passive at the higher prices. So as you guys can see, very clearly in terms of characteristics, we can see how to be buyers, both easy buyers at low prices but then also sort of more passive buyers at higher prices. As you can see the most important thing to understand is that a low volume area shows a natural bias or tendency towards one side and that is why we developed this trade strategy because it gives us relatively easier opportunity and understanding. Now, where we want to just finish off is in terms of execution.
