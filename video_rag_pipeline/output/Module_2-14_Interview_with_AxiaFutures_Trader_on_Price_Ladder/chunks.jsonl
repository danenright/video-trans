I had a period on the simulator before, but I had a full two years live now. I would say that on the ladder versus just having a simple chat, you feel more the participants. You see on the chat you can't see who wants to buy, who wants to sell. On the ladder, you can't hide yourself. If you want to buy, you have to put your order on the ladder. So automatically you see it and I feel like it's easier to feel the temperature of the market. So I have a couple of patterns that I like to trade on the ladder. For example, when I see a very quick acceleration... the price. Sometimes it's just one participant who needs to execute a trade and I like to try to to go against and try to steal one or two ticks in the other side of the market. Otherwise with the ladders sometimes I try to front run the big others when there is someone for example on the round number who wants to sell let's say 2000 bund at a certain price, I try to frontrun this price and to get couple ticks from this. I think to develop your abilities, especially at the beginning, you need to spend a lot of hours in front of the ladders. At the beginning it seems a little bit like a foreign language, so many times you don't After practice, you just get more and more obvious and I think at the beginning what's important is to take notes of your observations, to see what works, what doesn't work on the market and then you need to evolve with the market because you can see certain habits that take the market for a couple of weeks and then it's gone and you have... another kind of another type of market playing so it's good to have a good memory of what", "transcript": "I've been doing trading for two years live now.
