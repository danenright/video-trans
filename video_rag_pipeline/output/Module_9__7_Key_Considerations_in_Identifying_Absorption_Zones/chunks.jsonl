Firstly is understanding the relative speed of your market. Now when a market is oscillating in a certain range and then it meets a certain price point or a price zone and all of a sudden the orders start accelerating but the actual price is not budging and the market is not advancing on the upside or declining on the downside and the speed of orders that are going through would generally mean or decline but it's not well that's one of your key first key considerations in understanding the relative speed of the markets is so important in determining whether there's an iceberg order or not and also understanding the auctioning rate versus time spent so you know the the greater the velocity of the auction the orders that are being traded through versus a time Per minute and and the market isn't advancing usually a thousand watts per minute would normally result in the market moving You know three to four to five ticks as it takes out the relative average order size on the order book But now it's not even moving one more than one tick well therefore already You're observing a potential iceberg in play and and now it's determining how big is that iceberg below the surface and then also knowing when the counter side has exhausted has exhausted its ammunition once it speeds up sides so if there is an iceberg order and new trading within it But also understanding once the iceberg starts, you know, once it really starts exhausting the other side of the market. So if you have an iceberg on the sell side sitting on the offer at 50 and all of a sudden all the buyers are effectively trying to lift the offer and the iceberg keeps on reloading then the buyers just start becoming lethargic and they've not been able to buy as aggressively as they did and then it's now moved from 1,000 lots per minute 100 lots per minute then all of a sudden once the price starts declining there will be that paying threshold point for those people who've lost the battle against the iceberg when all the orders have to start unraveling and you'll see that in the videos that we look at and this is really important is knowing when the iceberg is effectively won its battle in that specific Also understanding the seasonal times of days and months, you know a lot of times you'll get iceberg Patterns when the markets highly active and incredibly aggressive and then it's easy to to observe the patterns And when do those occur that occurs, you know The beginning part of the month when risk is being put on the table when there's a technical a technical order flow such as month-end trades Regardless of you know, what time is just really important to understand the seasonal trends of the various markets of when certain types of iceberg absorption patterns can occur.", "transcript": "Let's look at key considerations in identifying absorption zones.
