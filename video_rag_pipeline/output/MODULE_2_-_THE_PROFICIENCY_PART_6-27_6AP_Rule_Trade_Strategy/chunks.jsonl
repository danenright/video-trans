Well, this is one of my favorite trade setups and for good reason We've got four different unique plays we can implement when talking about gap gaps and and trade strategy now I'm going to show you the basic principles and the basic pattern play behind, you know What a gap day would look like before we get to that. Let's just discuss What types of gaps we get? Okay. So the first we get is a technical gap the second would be a fundamental gap. Now don't forget guys, a gap in its own is a form of excess. It's showing us the market is highly skewed or there's a real lack of balance in the marketplace. So what we need to interpret firstly is what has created this excess or this you know very very non-symmetrical shape in the market. Well firstly could it be technical? In Have we had a huge move overnight in say Asia, and as a result the market is opening up below an area of stop out positions or a liquidation period? That's the first thing we need to interpret. What has created the gap in the market? Second, is it a fundamental gap? In other words, have we received some form of information overnight, some sort of something from maybe a central bank or maybe there's some huge political news out? Is there a fundamental reason that price needs to very aggressively shift? So that's the first thing we need to interpret. Now the reason is because technical gaps have a high probability or a higher probability Not just in that session, but in sessions thereafter whereas fundamental gaps on the other hand They have a slightly lower probability of filling within the that session and even sometimes Later sessions, so that's the first thing we want to interpret when talking about gaps and excess now The play is very simple Okay, we want to interpret whether or not the gap holds now As a rule of thumb, always remember if the gap holds in the market. So let's say that's our previous day's low and let's say this is the previous day's opening price. Now this gap effectively tells us there's initiative or potential for initiative or skew or probability. So straight away, you should see gap, you should see something like maybe dollar signs because that's what a gap means. A gap means there is potential for opportunity and probability in the market.

A gap means there is potential for opportunity and probability in the market. Now remember what we spoke about in earlier slides. We said when there's a skew in the market or a market that's out of balance, it's going to force lots of different positions, whether it's initiative positions, whether a lot of business or a lot of players into the market because suddenly prices shifted from there down to there. Now that creates opportunity for us as traders. However, we need to have unique strategies to implement and take advantage of the gap. So the first and most aggressive type of gap trade strategy will be where the gap does not fill. So let's take a look at what this example would typically look like. So, we have the previous day's profile. We then have the gap formed, and today we've opened and gapped on the previous day's range. Now, the first example is where the market opens, it facilitates trade in either direction, we distribute, but we cannot fill in the gap to the outside even after attempting. Now, this is the key to this trade strategy. attempt made. Now this attempt would typically come as the cash market opens. Now a lot of traders what they tend to do is they get a little bit too aggressive in these gap strategies and the reason is because they've come in, they've heard this news, they're thinking oh I better get on it otherwise I'm going to miss it and what they end up doing is they end up getting on that down leg whilst the market is just trying to find a little Let's say this market is gapped down 2%. That's a relatively large move. In other words, the market should almost be fully reflecting the new information. So bear that in mind that the market needs to attempt. We need to see the K print, the L print, maybe the N print, the N print, we need to see maybe a couple of prints, well it doesn't matter what they are, we need to failing to fill that gap in. Once we fail to fill that gap in and the market starts to look a little bit top heavy and starts to rotate lower and hold higher or lower and lower auctions, we then should see a continuation of the trend.

Now, let's take the second most aggressive example where the market fills the gap but fails to re-enter the previous day's range. So we have our gap, the market opens lower, it trades both sides and it starts to distribute and fills the previous day's range, so we no longer have a gap in the market. Now this is the second most aggressive because if the market cannot get back inside the previous day's range, it's telling us that we still have quite a strong sentiment towards the downside. Now the key to this trade strategy is again a little bit of patience. This is the one we tend to find that occurs most often with gaps. Markets don't like to leave gaps. Why? Because structurally they look very awkward, structurally they don't make much sense. So very often the market tends to fill in the gap but once it's kind of filled that gap in it can then look to continue to distribute lower. Now the key with this strategy is to allow the market to fill that gap, to allow the market to show us that a top is now in place and once it's allowed us and showed formed on maybe a slowing momentum, whatever it may be, once that top is formed we then start to see again the distribution towards the downside or the lower end of the profile. So again the reason we talk about the most aggressive and second most aggressive is that these are the most likely to show us or to hold the natural short term bias which in this case because the gap is to the downside will be to the downside. Now, the third, and again, this one's also particularly good to trade, is when we actually get the gap that gets filled and we re-enter the previous day's range. So again, we gap, the market facilitates trade on both sides, however, after distributing Now, the key with this strategy, and listen carefully because this is a particularly good strategy, the key with this strategy is to ask yourself what has created the gap and it comes back to the question of is it technical or fundamental.

A lot of short-term traders come into the market and all they're thinking is about the fundamentals. So we have a lot of aggressive shorts that have initiated new business in the market. Now by that very token, if people are initiating shorts but the market cannot go down, it's Once those short-term positions get squeezed a little bit too far, we tend to get a very aggressive reversal in the opposite direction. The last and the most aggressive reversal type price response is where we actually not only get into the previous day's value area, but we then extend to the other side of the previous day's value area. This is very similar to the third example. previous day's volume value area low. So that becomes a key pivot for us if the market initially holds this area as resistance, let me make this a little bit better. So the market holds this initial as resistance but then it starts to trade above it, it's highly likely we're going to trade very quickly and aggressively to the other side value. So that would be the fourth example we'd look for and it's very similar to the third. The only difference is we have a calculated target which would be once we get above the previous day's value area low we tend to then target the previous day's value area high. So those are the four examples. Now the key, the reason I show you these strategies a professional gap trader, what I just want to point out to you is that when there are gaps in the markets, on any day, it doesn't matter which day of the year it is or which market, when there is a gap, already I have got four trade opportunities listed on any given day where there's a gap.
