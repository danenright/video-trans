So what we have over here we have the gold market So this is gold and this is on the daily charts. So we have the daily chart over here Then we have crude oil so WTI and that's the futures. So we have crude and this is a 60 minute chart then what we have over here is the Bund futures and this is a five-minute chart and what I'm doing over here is showing you that regardless of the time frames markets are fractal by nature meaning whatever time frame they represent they still produce the same patterns and what I'm going to show you are congested zones before a momentum breakout zone what it graphically looks Over here, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 days of congestion between $12.77 level and $12.16, so within a $17 dollar range. Now what can be clearly observable is the market would expand beyond this boundary Or below the 1260s or below the 1260 so when the market expands beyond a region well, then that's what it's called It's in price discovery mode and once it goes to price discovery mode You normally see an unraveling of locked positions that were in here or where the congestion is and where there is congestion when the door Opens up there is a rapid move in the market and when you're trading your price ladder You're actually able to observe that a large difference or that change in momentum or the change change in price personality that you see on the ladder and it's your ability, regardless of what strategy you participate in, it's your ability to get the right size away when you're observing your ladder before the market starts expanding and vice versa. So this is one congestion zone, moving from congestion phase to expansion phase. this larger time frame we have this congestion on the daily charts volatility narrowing until we break this 1305 level and you see when you have a break of a key key zone the unraveling of the positions should see a pickup in volume and these are your volume histograms at the bottom so the volume on this daily chart picked up rather aggressively and then the same on this day once we broke this area, although we closed back in, you could see a higher than average volume compared to the preceding days when the market was trading in this range.

This is almost a classic volume price analysis, but when you're trading it on the ladder, you want to be seeing the change at these extreme points and then effectively executing your particular type of trade setups, which we talk later on in the module of various strategies such as your volume slam dunk, where you get away a lot of size or you find stops as being a stop hunter or passive positioning after the break and we talk about that in the low volume node passive positioning on the ladder analysis and video so that's the goal daily now even if you shift down time frames we're looking at the crude 60 minute you can see over here we were holding a range for one two three four five hours. So in five hours in a range between $50, $16 a barrel to $49.78. So it's a practically 30 ticks. And you can see once the once the market broke out. you could see that we started really expanding the range and we started seeking new value territory. So the market had found value here for about five hours and then once it moved out of the congestion zone it expanded its range until it moved into an entire new territory. So that's the crude 60 minute and now the same now we're looking at a five-minute chart and this is in the bun market now regardless of what market you're looking at same concept same principle So 163.61 and 169, so an 8 tick congested zone that lasted almost an hour and the moment it left this congested zone it got a little bit tricky because it snapped back in but once it started leaving you could see the large volume activity really starting to pick riding up and you'll be able to see that on your ladder and therefore you're able to execute very effective strategies and momentum type plays and strategies as the market seek new value as it escapes its previous congestion zone. Like anything in life, when you have congestion or when you have calm there's always peace before the storm or there's always the seasonal movements of things and the seasonal periods and then when the tide comes in it's exactly the same with the financial markets and these patterns and it's your ability on the price ladder to observe the shift in the auctioning exchange at these extremes to see that the market wants to now trade at new auctioning levels.
